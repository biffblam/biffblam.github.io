					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bee-in-my-bonnet time.<br /><br />The logline (http://gointothestory.blcklst.com/2014/01/spec-script-sale-security.html):<br /><br /><b>&quot;A security guard must protect a female witness from a gang of thugs in a mall after communication is knocked out from storm.&quot;</b><br /><br />I googled, because I figured it had to be a misquote, that &quot;is knocked out from storm.&quot; &nbsp;But that&#039;s the quoted logline I saw everywhere on the net. &nbsp;If we&#039;re following that pattern, why not:<br /><br />&quot;A security guard must protect female witness from gang of thugs in mall after communication is knocked out from storm.&quot;<br /><br /><i>Mongo like!</i><br /><br />I&#039;m gonna slot that &quot;a&quot; back in there, so I can quit straining to scratch that itch:<br /><br />Again, the logline:<br /><br />&quot;A security guard must protect a female witness from a gang of thugs in a mall after communication is knocked out from a storm.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s 23 words. &nbsp;I gave the logline author a freebie on the inserted &quot;a&quot;.<br /><br />Okay. &nbsp;The logline does the job. &nbsp;I believe it can be better. &nbsp;It has a disjointed, passive feel to it. &nbsp;I&#039;ll try to fix that.<br /><br /><b>&quot;A mall security guard must defend a female witness from thugs when a storm knocks out all communication.&quot;</b><br /><br />Down to 18 words.<br /><br />By shifting &quot;mall&quot; adjacent to &quot;security guard&quot; we&#039;ve implied the setting in one neat package without extra words.<br /><br />The verb &quot;protect&quot; is fine, but for me &quot;defend&quot; feels a wee bit more active and punchy. &nbsp;Maybe there&#039;s a better verb out there or maybe &quot;protect&quot; needs no fluffing. &nbsp;Whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />I sliced &quot;a gang of thugs&quot; to simply &quot;thugs&quot; on the assumption most people associate thugs with gangs. &nbsp;No meaning lost, so take the shorter path.<br /><br />I switched the storm/communications bit to active: subject, verb, object. &nbsp;It just reads better, IMO.<br /><br />Spec-sale congrats to screenwriter John Sullivan.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
