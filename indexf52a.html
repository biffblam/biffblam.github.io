					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div align="center">(https://10ptt.com/smf/10ptt_shake.gif)</div><br /><div align="center">(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/bunker1.jpg)</div><br />The script for THE BUNKER (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252963/) (2001) popped up on Horror Screenplay Archive (http://horrorscreenplays.blogspot.com/2011/11/bunker-2001.html) and the cheesy poster caught my eye. &nbsp;(If you&#039;d prefer to pay for it, you can purchase a printed copy (http://purchase a printed copy) on eBay for $14.50. Notice the eBayer does not mention the author&#039;s name anywhere on that page. Classy, dude. Color me cynical.)<br /><br />[EDIT: Author Clive Dawson (http://www.screenwriting.demon.co.uk/Clive%20Dawson%20Screenwriter.html) posted his script online here (http://www.screenwriting.demon.co.uk/Film_files/The%20Bunker.pdf)]<br /><br />I figured I&#039;d know by page one if this schlocked or rocked. &nbsp;Turns out page one rocked. &nbsp;Indeed the first ten rocked.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">It is 1944. A platoon of German soldiers, battle-weary and torn by tension and dissent, take refuge from advancing Allied forces, within the confines of an underground bunker system. As night closes in, a series of increasingly bizarre and horrifying events begin, leading ultimately to a deadly cat-and-mouse game of psychological warfare in a maze of tunnels. Are the soldiers being stalked by enemy soldiers, or have the demons from their past finally caught up with them.</div><br />or, as described by The Horror Club (http://thehorrorclub.blogspot.com/2009/03/23-bunker-2001.html):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">A bunch of pansy Nazi soldiers get too scared to fight anymore, and decide to hide out in a creepy old bunker. There they find an old man and a young boy, oddly enough both Nazi soldiers themselves, and they all decide to start a dance crew.</div><br />After watching the movie, I can tell you the second logline is the one I wish I&#039;d seen.<br /><br />Competent writing wasn&#039;t enough to get me motivated to 10PTT. &nbsp;What really toasted my nuggets was watching the film they made from Clive&#039;s script -- the first ten pages, anyway. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">That</span> got me sufficiently angry to get my ass in the chair, get my sneer on, and get stabby-stabby on the keyboard. What they filmed did not please me. I&#039;ll just go ahead and assume Clive Dawson feels the same. &nbsp;That would explain why after this movie he returned to TV for a full decade before trying features again (Last Days On Mars (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1709143/), 2012).<br /><br />Two problems announced themselves right out of the gate: Nazi soldiers speaking British English, and where the hell did the terrific ambush prologue go!<br /><br />War films can get away with Nazi characters speaking in non-German accents. &nbsp;Let me qualify that: good war films get away with it. &nbsp;I&#039;m old fashioned. &nbsp;Ja, I like mine Englisch-actor Nazis to sprechen Deutsch Englisch. &nbsp;Your brain is less likely to say, &quot;Waaait, why are all the Nazi&#039;s speaking English to each other&quot; than &quot;Whoa, why are all the Nazi&#039;s speaking <i>British</i> English.&quot; It helps with suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Why Nazis anyway? &nbsp;Would anything be lost by switching sides? &nbsp;Why not make the story about British soldiers fleeing the Germans, taking refuge in a British-controlled bunker? &nbsp;That sidesteps the accent issue. &nbsp;Probably make it more accessible to western audiences too. &nbsp;Just saying. &nbsp;Why German soldiers instead of British when the entire cast is British?<br /><br />And the ambush prologue. &nbsp;Spoiler alert: Pages 1–8 don&#039;t appear in the finished movie. At least not the cut I watched. However... <i>&quot;There is a pretty good gun battle early on but that&#039;s as close as it gets&quot;</i> says The Horror Enthusiast (http://www.thehorrorenthusiast.com/2008/10/bunker-dvd-review.html). &nbsp;That makes me wonder if the opening ambush made it into other versions, and I was unlucky enough to get the neutered one. &nbsp;Without that brutal five-minute prologue we meet the characters completely cold as they stumble through the forest toward the bunker. &nbsp;The &quot;ambush&quot; they refer to may as well be a &quot;dance-off with a rival street crew that turned ugly.&quot; &nbsp;Without that prologue battle the movie feels cheap, and it never recovers.<br /><br />For most of the movie my mind wandered back to all the glorious visual insanity oozing from Michael Mann&#039;s The Keep -- a vastly superior &quot;evil in the tunnels&quot; horror film in every way, even with its studio-inflicted flaws.<br /><br />Let&#039;s get to it.<br /><br /><br /><b>Annotation Legend</b><br /><br />GREEN = active verbs and punchy stuff. Easy to see where the pace picks up and eases up.<br /><br />PURPLE = passive construction. Not necessarily bad. Unless your page is awash in it. A little passive here and there can create a nice contrast, make your active sentences feel even punchier.<br /><br />RED = possible edits for various reasons<br /><br />CYAN = something&#039;s got me excited or appalled. Prepare to be lectured.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Longtime 10PTT <del>survivors</del> <del>prisoners</del> readers know I&#039;m sensitive to passive sentences. Whenever I spot one I get an overwhelming urge to tip that lazy s.o.b. out of its hammock and chase it around back to go chop wood. &nbsp;Something productive.<br /><br />&quot;is ----ing&quot;<br />&quot;is ----ed&quot;<br />&quot;are ----ing&quot;<br />&quot;is ---- by&quot;<br /><br />And all their mooching cousins spawned from the loins of Uncle NarratorVoice and Aunty TellDontShow.<br /><br />Even if a passive sentence feels like it belongs on the page, I&#039;ll still do the mental exercise of flipping it over to active, just for fun. &nbsp;Let&#039;s try that here.<br /><br /><i>-- &quot;Rubble and wood and construction equipment are scattered around.&quot;</i><br /><br />Our goal in this exercise is to remove the word &#039;are&#039; and those like it. &#039;Are&#039; is a benign-looking word. But what it&#039;s really doing is ever so slightly lulling your brain to sleep. If a dozen of these passive malingerers gather on a page you might actually nod off. &nbsp;And while you slumber these miscreants will feast on your vitality and poison your mojo, and you should burn your toothbrush just in case.<br /><br />We could go the sentence-fragment path:<br /><br />&quot;Rubble and wood and construction equipment all over.&quot;<br />&quot;Rubble and wood and construction equipment everywhere.&quot;<br /><br />We could merge the description into another sentence, to give it a more natural context:<br /><br />&quot;Two Organisation Todt guard work among the rubble and wood and construction equipment.&quot;<br /><br />Or there&#039;s the simple change of:<br /><br />&quot;Rubble and wood and construction equipment lie scattered around.&quot;<br /><br /><i>-- &quot;Dim work-lights are strung along the roof...&quot;</i><br /><br />&quot;Dim work-lights loop along the roof...&quot;<br />&quot;Dim work-lights hang along the roof...&quot;<br />&quot;Dim work-lights snake along the roof...&quot;<br />&quot;Dim work-lights thread along the roof...&quot;<br /><br />Or, retaining &#039;strung&#039; by switching word order:<br /><br />&quot;Work-lights strung from the roof pulse dimly...&quot;<br /><br /><i>-- &quot;Their noses and mouths are masked against the dust by grimy cotton scarves...&quot;</i><br /><br />&quot;Grimy cotton scarves keep their noses and mouths dust free...&quot;<br />&quot;Grimy cotton scarves shield their noses and mouths against the dust...&quot;<br />&quot;They breathe heavily through grimy cotton scarves...&quot;<br />&quot;Grimy cotton scarves serve as dust-masks...&quot;<br /><br />So that&#039;s our passive-to-active exercise done, and now we&#039;re warmed up and ready to weed out the passives wherever they clump together on a page. &nbsp;Moving along...<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;At the junction of a dark side-tunnel...&quot;</i><br /><br />I think this sentence and the suggested edits exemplifies how trimming can improve comprehension and readability. &nbsp;One thing good writers know is: less words is better. &nbsp;It seems like a trivial thing, but less words means your brain processes those little squiggles into meaning a tiny bit quicker. Stephen King ruthlessly trims at least 10% off every page. &nbsp;When you know what to look for, trimming isn&#039;t so tough. &nbsp;Find a single word that means the same as two words. &nbsp;Tighten the first sentence and cut the overlapping second sentence. &nbsp;Make a noun more specific and do away with the accompanying adjective. &nbsp;Anyway, back to Clive&#039;s sentence.<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;... are working furiously, hammering huge lengths of timber across the mouth of the side-tunnel...&quot;</i><br /><br />Don&#039;t tell us these guys are working furiously. We can see it! &nbsp;&quot;Two Organisation Todt guards ... furiously hammer huge lengths of timber....&quot; &nbsp;We&#039;ve shortened the sentence and lost none of the urgency.<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;As they continue working...&quot;</i><br /><br />is the same as &quot;As they work&quot; so choose the shorter unless there&#039;s good reason not to. &nbsp;Again, it can seem trivial, but all the little edits add up. &nbsp;Earlier I suggested shorter words/sentences get processed quicker by the brain. &nbsp;Syllable count is an example. &nbsp;In the original there are seven syllables. &nbsp;Revising gives three. &nbsp;That&#039;s half the time required for your brain to make sense of it. &nbsp;I know, crazy obsessive, right? &nbsp;I&#039;ll take it to my grave. &nbsp;<i>FIST PUNCHES through the sodden dirt. Lightning rips the sky, silhouetting the fresh grave and unspoiled headstone. The rotting arm protruding from the earth FLOPS left and right, groping. Finds a golfball-sized stone. The hand blindly searches the air then connects with the headstone. &nbsp;Slow SCRATCHING between BOOMS of thunder. The bony hand lets the stone plop to the ground. The arm retracts into the grave. CLOSE ON the headstone which formerly read: HERE LIES PITCHPATCH: HE WAS A GOOD MAN BUT A BAD RIDER OF EMUS. With words scratched out it now reads: PITCHPATCH: GOOD MAN, BAD EMU JOCKEY.</i><br /><br />-- <i>&quot;... and begins to quickly fill them in.&quot;</i><br /><br />Which is self-evident in the next line of dialogue. &nbsp;Screenplays require some narrative hand holding, but know when to stand aside and let your characters do their job.<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;The Sergeant glances <del>around</del> at the Private, but doesn&#039;t stop working.&quot;</i><br /><br />A cut purely to reclaim a line of white-space. See my other 10PTTs for all the reasons you should reclaim white-space where possible.<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;But the young Private <del>seems impatient and cavalier. He</del> ignores the comment...&quot;</i><br /><br />All that comes across in the Private&#039;s actions and dialogue. &nbsp;Pointing it out here is redundant. &nbsp;We get it.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Green proliferating here, so we know the pace is picking up.<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;Another plank is lifted into place, and the barricade is nearing completion.&quot;</i><br /><br />That&#039;s a perfectly serviceable sentence. &nbsp;I would only fault the double-barrel passives: &quot;is lifted&quot;, &quot;is nearing&quot;. &nbsp;Let&#039;s goose it. &quot;Another plank goes into place and the barricade is nearly done.&quot; &nbsp;I bet that fits on one line, so we shorten the page too. &nbsp;Oh wait. &nbsp;I cyaned &quot;nearing completion&quot; -- I think to point out that &quot;nearing completion&quot; is a slightly long-winded way of saying &quot;nearly complete&quot; or &quot;almost complete&quot; or &quot;almost done&quot;. &nbsp;Nothing terribly wrong with &quot;nearing completion.&quot; &nbsp;Just wanted to remind everyone about choosing the shortest, simplest words you can get away with -- unless choosing longer, denser words for effect.<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;... as the generator returns to its <del>previous</del> steady rhythm.&quot;</i><br /><br />To me, &quot;previous&quot; feels redundant in tandem with &quot;returns.&quot; &nbsp;When cutting words you ask yourself: does the sentence lose meaning after the trim? If no, it stays gone. &quot;Why bother cutting a word, Pitch?&quot; you groan. &nbsp;Because you must apply your own rules consistently. Do that long enough and it becomes automatic. &nbsp;You&#039;ll be a slick writing machine, you Krupp Dominator, you!<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;Scrabbling for their torches, starting to panic. The private watching bemused as the other two CURSE under their breath.&quot;</i><br /><br />Highlighted this one because it&#039;s a dynamic, effective couple of sentences. The first sentence fragment sets the tone -- we&#039;re seeing the other soldiers through the Private&#039;s viewpoint; the second hammers home the Private&#039;s dominant characteristic: he sees his comrades as superstitious fools. Two quick sentences and we know all about the Private and his misplaced bravado.<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;Their torches are on but the beams are feeble, struggling to penetrate the darkness.&quot;</i><br /><br />Clive takes two bites of the apple here. &nbsp;The torches have feeble beams; the beams struggle to penetrate the darkness. &nbsp;The two pretty much say the same thing. &nbsp;Now that I&#039;m looking at it again, why do we need &quot;their torches are on&quot; when we describe the torch beams in the next breath? &nbsp;Obviously the torches are on. &nbsp;I&#039;m thinking this is another case of 2+2, not 4. &nbsp;Why mention the torches are on when it cannot be any other way? &nbsp;So... &quot;Their torch beams struggle to penetrate the darkness&quot; or the more ruthless &quot;Their torches struggle to penetrate the darkness.&quot;<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;His voice ECHOES away into the darkness.&quot;</i><br /><br />Didn&#039;t highlight it on the page, but this bears brief discussion. &nbsp;We used &#039;darkness&#039; a sentence back. &nbsp;Now we&#039;re using it again. &nbsp;It&#039;s a minor thing, to be sure, but watch for reuse of a word too soon. It can be jarring and you&#039;ll soon find yourself watching for reuse of a word too soon. &nbsp;(Too soon?) &nbsp;A repeated word can be a lost opportunity to add to the scene. &nbsp;For example:<br /><br />&quot;Their torches struggle to penetrate the darkness... SERGEANT: Oh, Christ!... His voice ECHOES away into the black void.&quot;<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;A pause... ... then, from the side-tunnel, comes a new noise: A faint SCUFFLING sound.&quot;</i><br /><br />Clive is doing what good storytellers do: he&#039;s being a showman. &nbsp;But here I&#039;d argue he narratively dilutes the power of that sound cue. &nbsp;When filmed, the director and editor will achieve this moment in any number of ways, drawing out the pause to maximum dramatic effect. &nbsp;On the page there&#039;s no need to draw it out. &nbsp;&quot;A pause...&quot; on a line by itself is enough to seed my expectation. After that, don&#039;t tiptoe up to the reveal. &nbsp;HIT me with it:<br /><br /><i>A pause...<br /><br />From the side-tunnel comes a FAINT SCUFFLING sound.<br /></i><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

Passive construction. &nbsp;Stretching a verb like toffee and pinning it with an adverb. &nbsp;Bordering on contradiction: &quot;dropping&quot; implies gradual, &quot;rapidly&quot; implies... uh, rapid. &nbsp;And if you &quot;is ----ing&quot; me often enough I will for realsies make you cry and your little dog too.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">-- <i>&quot;Ebert, moving with lithe, catlike alertness despite his tiredness, throws Engels an idle, sideways glance.&quot;</i><br /><br />Does the catlike alertness apply solely to the glance Ebert throws at Engels? Or does &quot;moving&quot; refer to him slogging forward, and &quot;catlike alertness&quot; describes Ebert&#039;s general physical demeanor, i.e. all the while he trudges along he retains a catlike alertness? &nbsp;Don&#039;t let ambiguity trip your reader, forcing them to backtrack after wondering, &quot;Wait... Huh?&quot;<br /><br />If the former then that sentence seems way overblown, because it&#039;s describing the single action of Ebert glancing at Engels. Does Clive expect an actor to emote &quot;lithe, catlike alertness but tired&quot; all in a quick &quot;idle, sideways glance&quot;?<br /><br />If the latter then the sentence is an important piece of characterization describing Ebert&#039;s dominant physical characteristic -- that he can stay alert despite numbing fatigue.<br /><br />In either case, what I&#039;m not keen on are the nouns &quot;alertness&quot; and &quot;tiredness&quot;, which border on the abstract. &nbsp;When you spot vague nouns, as here, ask yourself this: &quot;Point to his alertness. Point to his tiredness. What are the material manifestations?&quot; &nbsp;For alertness you might point out, &quot;It&#039;s in his eyes, how they never stop sweeping the perimeter. It&#039;s the way he holds his weapon, as if still warm from the last firefight. &nbsp;It&#039;s in the way his lips pinch and relax as they roll a crooked, smoldering cigarette from one mouth corner to the other.&quot; &nbsp;For tiredness you might point out the way Ebert stumbles now and again. &nbsp;Mind sharp but body faltering. How he quietly fights for each breath.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean these are observations you should write into the script. &nbsp;This is simply another exercise to keep your writing from drifting onto autopilot. &nbsp;Give your abstract nouns close scrutiny. If you can make them concrete, all the better.<br /><br />The remainding suggested edits on this page are for brevity. &nbsp;There&#039;s a lot of fat weighing this page down. But perhaps that&#039;s appropriate given what&#039;s coming. &nbsp;Think of this page as the calm before the storm.<br /></div>

So for my money, we don&#039;t need to deep dive into description here.<br /><br />You&#039;ll notice Clive didn&#039;t just say &quot;pistol&quot; or &quot;luger&quot;. &nbsp;This author did his research. &nbsp;He uses concrete, authentic terms and identifiers where he can, to further immerse you in the time and setting.<br /><br />-- <i>&quot;... averts his eyes so as not to look upon the man he cannot help.&quot;</i><br /><br />Another novelistic turn of phrase that reads pleasantly enough but in the script world would be attacked and torn to shreds by... <i>*Pitchpatch scans the landscape for any roving packs of hungry wolves. &nbsp;Nada.*</i> ... Well, by me. I believe &quot;averts&quot; does all the heavy lifting here, so we lose nothing slimming down on the page what should remain a nice character moment on film.<br /><br />Plus... <i>wait for it...</i> we reel back a line of whitespace.&nbsp; Huzzah!&nbsp; Bunker Nazis in there, Grammar Nazi out here.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://www.writersguild.org.uk/news-a-features/film/418-from-the-bill-to-beverley-hills.html<br /><br />Clive talks about scripting Last Days On Mars, and his journey from The Bill to Hollywood.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Until its cancellation I was a regular writer on TV series The Bill, and had been for many years. I enjoyed writing for the show, particularly in its earlier incarnation of half-hour, stand-alone single dramas, but towards the end it became clear to many of the writers that the show was unlikely to survive; ITV had tampered with the format to the point of destruction. I’d written for other shows over the years but had never found another ‘home’ and, despite constant submissions and occasional development deals here and there, my original series and single drama ideas never seemed to find favour with the network heads. In short, my screen credits were limited, and once The Bill was axed my prospects in TV didn’t look good.<br /><br />Fortunately, I’d never entirely given up on the hope of working in film. <b>I’d had an original screenplay (a World War II psychological thriller entitled The Bunker) produced many years previously. Although I all but disowned the director’s turgid film version the screen credit itself was welcome and my screenplay continued to prove a well-received writing sample.</b> Nevertheless a subsequent film project, funded by the UK Film Council, ended up in legal limbo due to the collapse of the production company, and my long-standing agent gradually seemed to lose interest in promoting me. Now, with my regular TV work gone, it was time to either sink or swim.<br /><br />Against this backdrop, I decided to risk a little of my own money obtaining an option on a published short story, The Animators, by the prolific British author Sydney J Bounds. It’s an extremely creepy 11-page science-fiction thriller that I first read in an anthology many years ago, and I’d always felt it could form the basis of an effective film. A series of internet searches and emails to publishers finally led me to Philip Harbottle, the agent representing the estate of Syd Bounds. My initial query was polite and simple: were the rights to the story available, and if so, would it be possible to negotiate an option? To my amazement, the answer to both questions was yes. Phil was extremely accommodating and we eventually agreed an option for an initial sum, against a larger additional payment if the project went into fully-funded development...<br /></div><br />(emphasis mine)</div>
