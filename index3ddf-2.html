					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Twentieth Century Fox buys spec comedy &quot;From Mia With Love&quot; from writers Seth Grahame-Smith, David Katzenberg, Bryan Shukoff &amp; Kevin Chesley. Per Deadline:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Three guys so desperate to lose their virginity order up a Russian mail-order bride, figuring they can send her back. She is smoking hot but arrives with baggage and no plans to bed the lads, though she helps the trio become more suitable mating material.<br /><br />That&#039;s a clean high concept. Sounds like a John Hughes movie: Weird Science meets Green Card.<br /><br />Writers are repped by WME.<br /><br />Grahame-Smith is the writer of &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.&quot;<br /><br />Katzenberg, who will direct this project, is the son of DreamWorks principal Jeffrey Katzenberg.<br /><br />By my count, this is the 34th spec script to sell this year.<br /><br />The 34th spec script didn&#039;t sell in 2010 until August 17, so sales are up significantly this year.</div><br />Such a good log-line in my opinion.&nbsp; Gets it right out there and you know it hasn&#039;t been done before.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&quot;figuring they can send her back&quot; -- that&#039;s a delightfully absurd notion, emphasizing how they think of it as purchasing any old consumer item.&nbsp; Suggests part of the arc is the lads learning not to treat people as objects.</div>
