					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You&#039;ve already done the best thing for spam when you added the hexagon question. Shouldn&#039;t get any spambots that way. Human spammers are harmless, as well you know. LOL. I came here from screenwriting goldmine, from a spam link by a one poster. Wonder who that was hmmm?<br /><br />Anyway, glad you did. this looks like an OK site so far. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;scripts, screenwriting, writing, rewriting, screenplays, editing, film, movies&quot; /&gt;</div><br />as an aside you should consider adding &#039;critiques, critique, critiquing&#039; to your keyword list. First time I&#039;ve ever seen this forum software, be nice if it had a today&#039;s post tab, or something.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&gt;&gt; be nice if it had a today&#039;s post tab, or something.<br /><br />On the home page there&#039;s an &quot;Info Center&quot; block showing the most recent posts, plus there&#039;s a &quot;View the most recent posts&quot; link in the &quot;Forum Stats&quot; block at bottom of the home page.<br /><br />Can you link me to the page on Screenwriting Goldmine that includes the link back here?&nbsp; I did a Google search on &quot;site:screenwritinggoldmine.com link:10ptt.com&quot; and nothing showed up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not my forum and I&#039;m not bothered by it. It&#039;s the link that landed me here (never heard of this place before), so I&#039;m actually glad it&#039;s there. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been very impressed by the way you go through 10 pages of a script and strip it bare. I&#039;ve also been inspired to do the same thing with my own pieces. I have one screenplay awaiting, what i believe to be, final draft and am in the process of finishing second draft of another. I&#039;ve always preferred to write more than one project at once. I&#039;ve written for most of my life, I&#039;m just going to give it a shot at being professional now. I&#039;m 37, by the way. I also realise that most, if not all, of what i wrote growing up isn&#039;t worth the paper it&#039;s written on. I actually have two screenplays hand written from 10 years ago. Life and family got in the way for a while, but writing is what i&#039;ve always wanted to do.<br /><br />Thanks for the forum, you&#039;re doing a great job so far.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for introducing yourself, dotdotdot (??).<br /><br />Your story mirrors mine:&nbsp; missed some opportunities on the first go around; taking another swing later in life.<br /><br />The truly awesome thing about screenwriting?&nbsp; No age limit.&nbsp; Take a second chance.&nbsp; Take a third.&nbsp; A fourth.&nbsp; As many as you need to get there.&nbsp; While you&#039;ve got breath in your chest, clarity of thought, and an imagination that won&#039;t quit, success lies tantalizingly almost within reach.<br /><br />What keeps us going when others quit is a love of language and a love of storytelling.<br /><br />Welcome aboard the 10PTT ghost ship.<br /><br />(I wish I meant that as a thrilling prelude to actual ghostly encounters and exciting occult mysteries aboard 10PTT, but no.&nbsp; This forum is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">literally</span> a ghost ship sailing the internet backwaters.&nbsp; Thus my breathless wonder at discovering somebody linked here.&nbsp; As far as I know, the only other place doing so is Trevor Mayes&#039;s Scriptwrecked (http://scriptwrecked.com/).)<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Tantalus is right.&nbsp; Out in Hwood, living the &quot;dream&quot;, which resembles in reality an air-conditioned nightmare with lots of Armani-noose-types who offend worse than Oswald offering to pay for Jackie&#039;s dry-cleaning.&nbsp; But writing all the time.&nbsp; Found 10-page torture test through a forum somewhere and bookmarked.&nbsp; When I get a free moment, I&#039;d like to chain some language down and whip it until it reveals its secrets: what A? why do you pal around with &#039;n&#039; so much?&nbsp; Until then, I sit and stare at blank pages until they stare back and somewhere in that confusing conversation, stories are born.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>
