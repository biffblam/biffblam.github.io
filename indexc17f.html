					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">&quot;Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she was now staring was clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.&quot;</div><br />Take that Dan Brown sentence from THE DA VINCI CODE and rewrite it for the script page. &nbsp;First, convert to present tense:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she is now staring is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />&quot;Almost inconceivably&quot; is an annoying &quot;have your cake and eat it&quot; phrase, like &quot;Her eyes were almost pure blue but with a tiny hint of grey.&quot;<br /><br />With that sentence Dan Brown tells us this: She almost can&#039;t believe an albino holds a gun on her, but she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does</span> believe it. &nbsp;In her mind it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> conceivable. &nbsp;So why mention it at all? &nbsp;It only makes sense if she&#039;s truly shocked, if this turn of events is truly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inconceivable</span> -- which it is! &nbsp;So we must lose the &quot;almost.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, the gun into which she is now staring is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />&quot;the gun into which she is now staring&quot; is a painful way of saying &quot;the gun she&#039;s staring into&quot;...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, the gun she&#039;s staring into is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />&quot;the gun she&#039;s staring into&quot; -- we could knock out this &quot;-ing&quot; word by substituting &quot;the gun she stares into&quot;...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, the gun she stares into is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />I&#039;m still not comfortable with &quot;the gun she stares into.&quot; &nbsp;How about &quot;the gun in her face.&quot; &nbsp;Not shorter, but it feels to me like a smoother bridge between the elements in this sentence: her face, the gun, the albino&#039;s hand, the albino.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, the gun in her face is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />&quot;clutched&quot; is unnecessary detail. &nbsp;It adds nothing to the narrative. &nbsp;If the way the albino man holds the gun suggests something about his character or state of mind then fine. &nbsp;That&#039;s not the case here. &nbsp;The word must go. &nbsp;Ditto &quot;pale.&quot; &nbsp;A pale hand could easily belong to a non-albino person. &nbsp;Both words add nothing and we lose nothing in striking them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, the gun in her face is in the hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />&quot;is in the hand of&quot; equals &quot;held by.&quot; &nbsp;I could argue &quot;is in the hand of&quot; is the elegant choice, but our mandate is ruthless brevity.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, the gun in her face is held by an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />We could stop there and be happy. &nbsp;Let&#039;s review our script page edit:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she is now staring is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.<br /><br />Inconceivably, the gun in her face is held by an enormous albino with long white hair.<br /></div><br />&quot;is held by&quot; is forced on us by the desire to keep the passive construction to properly effect the albino man&#039;s reveal. &nbsp;It feels clunky and self serving. &nbsp;How about:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, the gun in her face belongs to an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />Comparing original and edited:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she is now staring is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.<br /><br />Inconceivably, the gun in her face belongs to an enormous albino with long white hair.<br /></div><br />Have we lost significant meaning in our edit? &nbsp;Have we introduced confusion, vagary, ambiguity? &nbsp;The only thing I&#039;d consider is how the new sentence frames the shot with less precision. &nbsp;The original sentence heavily implies a visual focus traveling from her face to the gun to the albino&#039;s hand to the albino. &nbsp;The revision leaves it to the reader/director to frame the shot in their heads.<br /><br />Go ahead and offer your own rewrite (and your whyfors) in the comments.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, the gun into which she is now staring is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />Let&#039;s go back. &nbsp;What happens if we ditch passive and permit &quot;the gun&quot; to arrive later in the sentence?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, she&#039;s staring into a gun clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />Immediate improvement, and the gun element remains in focus. &nbsp;Let&#039;s keep at it:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Inconceivably, she&#039;s staring into a gun held by enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />Comparing Brown&#039;s original with our first and second edits:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">0: Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she is now staring is clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair.<br /><br />1: Inconceivably, the gun in her face belongs to an enormous albino with long white hair.<br /><br />2: Inconceivably, she&#039;s staring into a gun held by an enormous albino with long white hair.</div><br />Both edits boost readability. &nbsp;If anything, the second version projects more character viewpoint and therefore is more emotionally charged.<br /></div>
