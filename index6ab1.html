See http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html. &nbsp;Importantly, see here (http://10ptt.com/smf/index.php/topic,8.0.html) why you shouldn&#039;t assume Fair Use shields you from copyright claims.</li></ul><br />Some not-okay situations:<br /><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>You didn&#039;t get permission from all the work&#039;s authors/owners</li><li>You want to 10PTT an in-development, publicly-unavailable script you got from script trading</li></ul><br /><br /></li><li type="square"><b>STEP 2</b><br /><br />Create your 10PTT. &nbsp;Originally I produced the final marked-up page images in Gimp. Now my preferred mark-up tool is the free PDFXchange Viewer (http://www.tracker-software.com/product/downloads). This tool offers all the basic PDF mark-up features you&#039;ll need. &nbsp;When finished, you can take a screenshot of each page for use in your 10PTT review.<br /><br /><br /></li><li type="square"><b>STEP 3</b><br /><br />Create a new topic for your 10PTT in the 10PTT area. &nbsp;First post can be an introduction or jump right into analyzing the first page. Post the remaining pages separately as replies to your new topic.<br /><br />You can attach your page images to your post, and they&#039;ll be stored on this site. &nbsp;However, there are file size limits.<br /><br />An alternative is to host the page image files on another site, like tinypic.com, and link to them in your post. &nbsp;A good solution is opening a wordpress.com account, adding the page files in the media section, and linking to them in your post. &nbsp;That way you can be sure the page images won&#039;t get deleted by a third-party image hosting site. See here (http://10ptt.com/smf/index.php/topic,11.0.html) how I linked an image to my wordpress.com blog.<br /></li></ul></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">All the threads here are started by Pitchpatch and already marked up.&nbsp; If I want to post my own script to be reviewed, do I just start a thread and post the 10 pages, each as its own post?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi, Elisa.<br /><br />The idea is not to post pages for review but post pages <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you&#039;ve reviewed</span>, 10PTT style.&nbsp; You correctly point out, so far I&#039;m the only goon posting 10PTTs.&nbsp; I&#039;d love for others to give it a try, but I understand it can be time consuming to mark up the pages for presentation here.&nbsp; That&#039;s my guess why I&#039;m the sole contributor so far.<br /><br />Being considerably lazy myself, I post 10PTTs only occasionally and only when the planets align.&nbsp; Once I tuck into a 10PTT I enjoy the heck out of the process and tell myself I should do one a month -- nay, one a week.&nbsp; But that euphoria cools quickly after page 10 goes up.<br /><br />Back to you.&nbsp; One thing we forum operators do when a new member joins is turn to the creepy stalking machine that is Google, to gauge if the new member is genuine or a potential spammer.&nbsp; If we don&#039;t do this early cursory check, later our forums pay for it when &#039;rjM0007x32 at secretmail.com&#039; starts flooding the boards with strangely-out-of-context replies containing obviously spammy links.<br /><br />A quick web scan for your name easily demonstrated you&#039;re a legit pre-pro screenwriter, with your five-page scene entry titled A CRY IN THE DARK (http://cyberspaceopen.com/2011spring/a.cry.in.the.dark.32084.elisa.graybill.pdf) on public view at http://cyberspaceopen.com/ (a screenwriting competition site).<br /><br />I read the pages. Your writing is industry ready.&nbsp; That means I believe I could slip your work randomly into the pre-screened stack of scripts on a professional reader&#039;s desk and the reader would not stop to wonder if it got there by mistake, if maybe colleague reader Suzy slipped her eccentric neighbor&#039;s screenplay into your vetted pile just for giggles.<br /><br />I did spot one comma behavior that invites correction, and story-wise I&#039;m not sure the angel pays off in any meaningful way -- inside that scene, anyway.&nbsp; But clearly you&#039;re a long way up the professional hill, and now it mostly comes down to herding the story cats into an impressive controlled stampede through Hollywood&#039;s corridors.&nbsp; (Worst/best metaphor ever.)<br /><br />If you still want somebody to 10PTT your pages (no more than ten of &#039;em) then email a PDF to <i>tenpagetorturetest at gmail.com</i> and I&#039;ll take a look.<br /><br />Oh, and welcome to the site!<br /></div>
