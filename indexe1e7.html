					Post by: <b>Pitchpatch</b> on <b>February 25, 2013, 03:35 AM</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ll show you a short passage from a recent spec and demonstrate why to me the script feels overwritten. &nbsp;The red flags are the page count (137) and the plentiful long paragraphs. &nbsp;Plus too much minutia. &nbsp;Just my opinion, of course. &nbsp;If you disagree speak up and tell me why. &nbsp;This site is all about surfacing the thought process behind language choices.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">EXT. THEBES PALACE GARDENS - DAY<br /><br />A slave girl whispers, her hand cupped to the side of<br />Tiye’s head. Tiye’s eyes widen with astonishment. She<br />turns to face the girl.<br /><br />TIYE<br />Where?<br /><br />The girl points to the maze in the centre of the huge<br />gardens. Tiye nods. The girl bows and quickly walks<br />away. Tiye starts to move towards and enters the large<br />maze. For a few moments she wanders around, clearly<br />lost. Then, she hears giggling. She stops. The voices<br />fade, so she starts moving again. Again she hears<br />voices. She is so focussed that she suddenly rounds a<br />corner, and walks into a small group of doves resting<br />there. They rise up in to the air. Tiye herself screams<br />in fright, then quickly regains her composure.<br /><br />Suddenly, the voices have stopped. She curses herself,<br />then starts to slowly hedge around the maze. She turns<br />yet another corner, when suddenly, standing there alone<br />is Tutankhamen. He looks at her questioningly.</div><br />Could be sliced down to:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">EXT. THEBES PALACE GARDENS - DAY<br /><br />A slave girl whispers into Tiye&#039;s ear.<br />Tiye&#039;s eyes widen with astonishment.<br /><br />TIYE<br />Where?<br /><br />The girl points to the large central maze in the<br />huge gardens. With a nod, Tiye dismisses her<br />and starts toward the maze.<br /><br />She wanders its paths, clearly lost. Then:<br />GIGGLING.<br /><br />She listens. The voices fade. She moves on. <br />More VOICES.<br /><br />As she rounds a corner, startled doves take wing<br />in a noisy, gusty flurry. Tiye screams.<br /><br />She curses, calms herself. The voices have stopped.<br />She begins to hedge around the maze. Turns another<br />corner --<br /><br />And there stands Tutankhamen. He regards her with<br />suspicion.</div><br />Note, there&#039;s a missing &#039;INT. MAZE&#039; (or a sub-locational &#039;MAZE&#039;) that logically falls here:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Tiye starts to move towards and enters the large<br />maze.<br /><br />IN THE MAZE<br /><br />For a few moments she wanders around, clearly<br />lost.<br /></div><br />Let&#039;s break down the stats*:<br /><br />ELEMENT: BEFORE | AFTER<br /><br />Lines: 24 | 27<br />Paragraphs: 4 | 8<br />Sentences: 21 | 19<br />Words: 163 | 105<br />Syllables: 190 | 130<br />Avg Words Per Sentence: 8 | 6<br />Avg Sentences Per Paragraph: 5| 2<br />Avg Words Per Paragraph: 41 | 13<br />Avg Syllables Per Paragraph: 47 | 16<br /><br />Those stats strongly suggest improved readability. &nbsp;The line count blew out by three, but the restored white space is worth it.<br /><br />The context now carries the narrative. &nbsp;&quot;A slave girl whispers into Tiye&#039;s ear&quot; -- the cupped hand is an unimportant detail we might imagine anyway.<br /><br />&quot;Tiye’s eyes widen with astonishment&quot; -- still feels wordy to me. &nbsp;&quot;Tiye&#039;s eyes flash astonishment.&quot; &nbsp;Technically correct but still clunky. &nbsp;It&#039;s the abstract noun &quot;astonishment&quot; I&#039;d like to remove; &nbsp;&quot;-ment&quot; abstract nouns should be switched with simpler word forms where possible. &nbsp;Maybe: &quot;Astonished, Tiye&#039;s eyes widen.&quot; &nbsp;Or &quot;Tiye&#039;s eyes flash, astonished.&quot; &nbsp;Or letting context do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> the heavy lifting: &quot;Tiye&#039;s eyes go wide.&quot; &nbsp;Action, reaction. &nbsp;Trust the reader to connect the dots without unnecessary hand-holding.<br /><br />&quot;She turns to face the girl.&quot; &nbsp;Remove it. &nbsp;Review. &nbsp;Any meaning, mood, emotion lost? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;That sentence does nothing but eat precious white space. &nbsp;Kill it.<br /><br />&quot;The girl bows and quickly walks away&quot; -- don&#039;t give your minor characters the same attention as your majors. &nbsp;That&#039;s why they&#039;re minor characters. &nbsp;Get them on and off screen without fuss.<br /><br />&quot;She is so focussed that she suddenly rounds a corner, and walks into a small group of doves resting there. They rise up in to the air.&quot; &nbsp;Large group, small group -- not important. &nbsp;What&#039;s important is Tiye (and the audience) getting startled. &nbsp;So focus on that. &nbsp;The suddenness has to be on the page, and &quot;rise up into the air&quot; is way too languid to provoke shock.<br /><br />&quot;He looks at her questioningly&quot; -- okay, but what emotion does that suggest? &nbsp;Curiosity? &nbsp;Amusement? &nbsp;Outrage? &nbsp;We don&#039;t know. &nbsp;It&#039;s too vague.<br /><br />Mantra time: give &#039;em two plus two, not four.<br /><br /><br /><br />* Subsequently I made minor tweaks to the revised text.&nbsp; The original stats will be slightly off now.</div>
