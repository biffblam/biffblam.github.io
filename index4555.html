					Post by: <b>Pitchpatch</b> on <b>May 20, 2017, 08:10 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rakan posted this 90-page dystopian SF screenplay (https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/6ar6nv/feedback_the_girl_who_grew_wings_dystopian_scifi/) to Reddit.&nbsp; I quite like the writing, but right from the first page I was compelled to &quot;fix&quot; something I knew would bug me more and more with each page turn.<br /><br />Read for yourself the opening page, then I&#039;ll tell you what bugged me.<br /><br />
<div class="scrippet">
<p class="sceneheader">INT. THE TOWER</p>
<p class="action">The staccato pounding of footsteps and the frantic scratching of paws against metal.</p>
<p class="action">The surroundings are desolate, steam-punk, corroding.</p>
<p class="action">Rusting stairs spiral up, ending in just a touch of baby blue light emanating from a door.</p>
<p class="action">A girl (19) runs past us, her long dark hair bobbing behind her. Her physique is lithe, on the taller side, brown eyes laden with desperation.</p>
<p class="action">After her follow the dogs. Huge, deadly mastiffs.</p>
<p class="action">One, two, three.</p>
<p class="action">Then a woman (43). Face as tough as sandpaper, skin clinging to bone, a wide frame, let's call her the Warden.</p>
<p class="action">Glancing down, the girl sees that the dogs are only a few flights below her. She looks up: only five more storeys to go.</p>
<p class="action">Fights to control her breath.</p>
<p class="action">The dogs are gaining, spittle dragging on the floor after them.</p>
<p class="action">Light streams from the door, the girl rounds the corner and--</p>
<p class="action">The first dog bites her ankle. She topples over, trying to fight it off. The second dog jumps-</p>
<p class="action">-and lands on her chest, ripping at her clothes. She writhes away from the attack, but the third dog begins to attack, forcing her to stay down.</p>
<p class="action">Even as she works to fight them off, the girl's body twitches as the dogs maul and savage her flesh.</p>
<p class="action">A piercing whistle from the Warden. As fast as they had started, the dogs leap back.</p>
<p class="action">Her face is mangled, her body irreparably torn.</p>
<p class="action">The Warden looms above, crouches down to the girl.</p>
<p class="action">Through the girl's one open eye, we see fear in its purest form.</p>
<p class="character">WARDEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You're a fast one.</p>
<p class="action">The girl wheezes, trying to stop the blood spurting from her neck.</p>
<p class="character">WARDEN (cont'd)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Got nice legs.</p>
<p class="action">The Warden lifts the girl above her shoulder and flings her off of the catwalk.</p>
<p class="action">The girl's body flies down, past the floors, finally hitting the ground with a resounding</p>
<p class="action">THUD!</p>
<p class="action"></p>
</div>
<br />FADE IN on action and conflict -- good stuff.&nbsp; This hook will keep readers reading.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />The pacing and focus are muddy as hell.&nbsp; For me, the words do not create a fully coherent sequence of images and events.&nbsp; I found myself halting several times to make sense of the narrative&#039;s handling of time and space.<br /><br />The layout of the stairs, for example.&nbsp; It takes a moment to realize we&#039;re in a stairwell.&nbsp; The girl whips by, and we&#039;re told dogs are chasing her.&nbsp; The way it&#039;s written, it feels like the dogs are nipping at her heels, but then we learn the dogs are still a couple floors down.&nbsp; We learn the girl&#039;s destination is five floors up and, after that quick moment to catch her breath, she&#039;s off again.&nbsp; We briefly cut to the dogs, then we&#039;re back with the girl and she&#039;s already at the blue door.&nbsp; It feels like she covered those five floors in a crazy short amount of time.&nbsp; Not only that but the dogs have caught up too.<br /><br />I figured this page would read better by shot-slugging the action and adding some narrative glue.&nbsp; Also, I sprinkled some figurative language here and there.&nbsp; This page, as written, has none.&nbsp; To add color, energy, and humanity to your writing, every screenplay page should include some figurative language.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my revision.&nbsp; I use about 40 words more, but I think it&#039;s worth it.<br /><br />
<div class="scrippet">
<p class="sceneheader">INT. THE TOWER</p>
<p class="action">Staccato POUNDING of footsteps.<br>Frenetic SCRATCHING of claws against metal.</p>
<p class="action">A STAIRWELL</p>
<p class="action">Narrow and rusting, it spirals way up to a door emanating baby-blue light.</p>
<p class="action">Everything here is desolate, steam-punk, corroding.</p>
<p class="action">A YOUNG WOMAN</p>
<p class="action">tall and lithe STREAKS BY, her long black hair whipping behind her.</p>
<p class="action">At the hand-rail she stops to glance down --</p>
<p class="action">TWO FLOORS BELOW</p>
<p class="action">sighting one, two, THREE MUSCULAR MASTIFFS, jaws snapping, drool flapping, driven nearly mad by the close scent of prey. This anarchy of tooth and tail and claw under the casual-but-firm control of --</p>
<p class="action">THE WARDEN</p>
<p class="action">a heavy woman with sandpapery skin and unblinking eyes that tick left and right, lizard-like. &nbsp;Now ticking upward to observe --</p>
<p class="action">THE YOUNG WOMAN</p>
<p class="action">twists away from the rail, fights to get her breath back. &nbsp;She peers up: only five floors to go.</p>
<p class="action">THE MASTIFFS</p>
<p class="action">bark, jostle, snort and lunge, responding to the Warden's every command and encouragement as they relentlessly ascend the stairwell, floor by floor, closing in on --</p>
<p class="action">THE YOUNG WOMAN</p>
<p class="action">turns a corner and the blue door is there, the handle is right there! &nbsp;She reaches for it --</p>
<p class="action">HUGE TEETH seize her ankle and the lead mastiff claims her, drags her down like a crocodile snatching a gazelle from the river's edge.</p>
<p class="action">The girl rolls onto her back, fists clenched but knowing the fight is over already because the second dog has her now, and the third. &nbsp;Screaming defiance while the dogs RIP AND TEAR, until the lead mastiff nuzzles her throat and BITES --</p>
<p class="action">A PIERCING WHISTLE</p>
<p class="action">The dogs retreat slowly, growling in protest.</p>
<p class="action">With one good eye left in her mangled face, the girl gazes up in terror as the Warden crouches over her.</p>
<p class="character">WARDEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You're a fast one.</p>
<p class="action">The Warden's smile tells the rest: <i>But not fast enough.</i></p>
<p class="action">The girl wheezes, feebly tries to staunch her spurting neck.</p>
<p class="character">WARDEN (cont'd)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Got nice legs.</p>
<p class="action">Until now. &nbsp;Now they look like flayed slaughterhouse meat.</p>
<p class="action">The Warden easily deadlifts the girl above her head. FLINGS her over the railing, and waits for the jarring, wet --</p>
<p class="action">WHUUUMP!</p>
<p class="action"></p>
