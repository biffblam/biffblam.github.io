					Title: <b>THE BLACK LIST 2014 - Logline Beat Down</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Pitchpatch</b> on <b>November 01, 2015, 03:19 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">With just a half-dozen weeks remaining until Black List 2015, I present to you my thoughts on the BL2014 loglines.<br /><br />First thought: there&#039;s a lot of them. &nbsp;I have appraised, poked, and prodded around half so far. &nbsp;Therefore, this year I&#039;ll post them individually to this topic with a gush of loglines up front followed by a trickle at the back end.<br /><br />Yeah. &nbsp;Try to not think about diarrhea. &nbsp;You can&#039;t. &nbsp;But you must. &nbsp;Because we&#039;re here to focus on those supremely important 25-40 words out of the many thousands you&#039;ll type telling your story.<br /><br />Imagine, if you will -- DING! -- you step from your hotel elevator having arriving at, oh let&#039;s say, Floor 13. &nbsp;Before you a long, sparsely lit corridor stretches away into darkness.<br /><br />You see other hallways intersecting this one at regular intervals. &nbsp;Punctuating these hallways are room doors. &nbsp;Too many doors to count. &nbsp;There are agents and producers roaming these hallways like white blood cells through a pulsing artery: vigilant, restless, questing. &nbsp;These busy workers hurry from door to door, pausing only to inspect each nameplate. &nbsp;Most of the time an agent will shake their head in disappointment before hastening to the next door. Once in a while an agent will judge a nameplate satisfactory. &nbsp;That agent will smile with relief, straighten their back, neaten their appearance. &nbsp;Even then, with a hand firmly gripping the doorknob, the agent will hesitate for a moment before turning it, as if knowing this decision to enter will come at a price. &nbsp;The moment passes, the agent puts on an irresistibly charming smile, and in they go. &nbsp;The door closes. &nbsp;Perhaps in a while some other agent will arrive at this same door, find the nameplate agreeable, try the doorknob... and, finding it locked, move on. &nbsp;Always moving on.<br /><br />Yes, of course they are: those nameplates are loglines. &nbsp;Your logline controls who stops at your door, who turns the knob, who greets you with a warm smile and a firm handshake.<br /><br />Polish your nameplate. &nbsp;Before or after your script gets written, you&#039;d better polish your nameplate.<br /><br />This year my arbitrary, subjective, scandalous and frivolous 4-star rating system is this: “nope,” “hmmm,” “good,” and “aces”. &nbsp;I&#039;m rating the logline only -- not the writer, not the script, not story potential. &nbsp;It&#039;s all about logline execution. &nbsp;Does it zing (Google) or does it bing (Microsoft)?<br /><br />Especially note that when I riff on a logline I&#039;m probably straying far from the author&#039;s original story idea. &nbsp;Doing a plain word polish on a logline is the business end. &nbsp;Playing with logline story elements is the fun part.<br /><br />Respect as always to these hard-working authors striving to entertain the world and make a living doing it, and congratulations to every one of you for making the 2014 Black List.&nbsp; Though I make fun of some of these loglines, folks, remember: every one of these Black List screenplays will probably knock your socks off.&nbsp; Find them online, read them.&nbsp; Then come back here and tell me how you&#039;d change the logline to do justice to the story.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">THE SWIMSUIT ISSUE - good<br />Randall Green <br /><br /><b>A nerdy high schooler, who fancies himself an amateur photographer, attempts to create a &quot;Swimsuit Issue&quot; featuring his high school classmates in hopes of raising enough money to go to summer camp.</b><br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/swimsuit.jpg)<br /><br />&quot;Nerdy,&quot; &quot;fancies,&quot; &quot;attempts,&quot; and &quot;hopes&quot; all foreshadow conflict and struggle. &nbsp;Strong goal and through-line. &nbsp;Why summer camp? &nbsp;Because of a certain girl? &nbsp;I reckon so.</div>

					Title: <b>THE BLACK LIST 2014 - Logline Beat Down - ROTHCHILD</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Pitchpatch</b> on <b>November 01, 2015, 04:09 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ROTHCHILD - good<br />John Patton Ford <br /><br /><b>A young, well-educated loner kills the members of his mother&#039;s estranged family one-by-one in hopes that he will inherit the family&#039;s vast fortune. </b><br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/rothchild.jpg)<br /><br />Seethes with intrigue and high drama. &nbsp;Money as motivation is something we all understand. &nbsp;Simple, powerful story spine. &nbsp;However, the LL risks leaving us feeling like we&#039;ve seen the whole movie. &nbsp;Hinting at a twist or a complication would mitigate that risk. &nbsp;Maybe something like:<br /><br />&quot;An intelligent young loner will need to do more than kill his mother&#039;s relatives one by one to inherit his family&#039;s vast fortune.&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">THE WALL - good<br />Dwain Worrell <br /><br /><b>A sniper and his spotter must kill and avoid being killed, separated from an enemy sniper by only a 16x6ft prayer wall.</b> <br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wall.jpg)<br /><br />Proximity is the exciting element in this LL. &nbsp;I wonder if some mojo leaks out by not hinting why the enemy sniper must be stopped. &nbsp;For example:<br /><br />&quot;A sniper and his spotter must secure safe passage for a vital diplomatic convoy by eliminating the enemy sniper who&#039;s got them pinned behind a 16-by-6-foot prayer wall.&quot;<br /><br />Suggesting stakes beyond basic survival boosts the overall appeal, I think.</div>

					Post by: <b>Pitchpatch</b> on <b>November 01, 2015, 05:42 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">THE CASCADE – nope (revised to &quot;hmmm&quot; on a second pass)<br />Kieran Fitzgerald <br /><br /><b>Based on the documentary style film &quot;The Day Britain Stopped&quot; directed by Gabriel Range, an oil tanker collides with an Iranian patrol boat in the Strait of Hormuz, triggering a chain of tragic disastrous events. </b><br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/end.jpg)<br /><br />Feels generic and lacks a protagonist and through-line. &nbsp;LL offers a promise of excitement but you have to take it on faith. &nbsp;I&#039;m unfamiliar with the documentary cited, so for me the LL can&#039;t simply name check and expect me to fill in the blanks. &nbsp;I get annoyed with placeholder text like “a chain of tragic disastrous events.” &nbsp;Give us something to chew on.<br /><br />Looking at the source material&#039;s Wikipedia entry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_Britain_Stopped), THE DAY BRITAIN STOPPED is described as “based on a fictional disaster on 19 December 2003, in which a train strike is the first in a chain of events that lead to a meltdown of the country&#039;s transport system.” &nbsp;Ah, okay. &nbsp;Got it. &nbsp;So, the movie – aptly named, I see now – charts a series of causally linked escalating events all the way to some unimaginable, shocking outcome. &nbsp;That&#039;s actually a cool premise.<br /><br />So, ignoring the first bit that gives context we&#039;re left with: &quot;An oil tanker collides with an Iranian patrol boat in the Strait of Hormuz, triggering a chain of tragic disastrous events.&quot; &nbsp;Not a terrible logline but not a good one. &nbsp;It feels flat. &nbsp;It shouldn&#039;t. &nbsp;We&#039;re talking about events that rock one or more nations. &nbsp;Surely there&#039;s a particular character weaving in and out of most story events? &nbsp;Can&#039;t we tag along with that person? &nbsp;If we can, here&#039;s what the logline might look like:<br /><br />&quot;An inexperienced government minister must stop a chain of escalating tragedies when an oil tanker collides with an Iranian patrol boat in the Strait of Hormuz.&quot;<br /><br />Now we don&#039;t need the introductory context. &nbsp;We let the logline lead. &nbsp;The context follows and helps seal the deal in the room: &quot;And by the way, it&#039;s based on the documentary style film &#039;The Day Britain Stopped&#039; directed by Gabriel Range. &nbsp;Have you seen it? &nbsp;Also by the way, I know that&#039;s a picture of Sydney Harbour and the Opera House, not the Strait of Hormuz. &nbsp;Let me explain in one word... Sequel.&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">AETHER - nope<br />Krysty Wilson-Cairns <br /><br /><b>In near future London, a revolutionary technology has been invented that can record sounds hours after they were made. Detective Harry Orwell, inventor of this technology, is part of a pilot program where investigators record and analyze past sound waves and finds himself the prime suspect while investigating a string of brutal murders. </b><br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/listening.jpg)<br /><br />Takes too long to make its pitch. &nbsp;Raises all kinds of questions about the story rules for this new technology – like, exactly how many hours back can the tech capture a sound? &nbsp;But a wordy logline ruins this interesting premise of retroactive sound recording. &nbsp;Including the protagonist&#039;s name – an unnecessary element in all but biographical loglines – seems driven by the desire to throw a sly wink in George Orwell&#039;s direction. &nbsp;With a slimmer logline this might earn a “good.” &nbsp;Try this:<br /><br />&quot;A detective in near-future London invents a device to reconstruct recent sound waves. &nbsp;While investigating a string of grisly murders, the device fingers him as the prime suspect.&quot;<br /></div>

In the original, the intelligence contractor could be South Korean, could be any nationality. Plenty of reasons the CIA would get involved if the defector wasn&#039;t American.&nbsp; So let&#039;s just carve that in stone: the contractor is American.&nbsp; If pitching to Hollywood, we instantly boost our sale prospects.<br /><br />2. The Cold War expert now has a strong goal: retrieve the bag.&nbsp; We can confidently surmise the bag will contain something far more alarming than whatever he was briefed about.<br /><br />3. Trope-y, I know, but “retired” at least gives us something to hang our hat on.&nbsp; It can be anything – whatever serves as a focal point for us to form a picture of this veteran operative:&nbsp; a deaf Cold War operative; a homeless Cold War operative; a Cold War operative turned grizzled Hells Angel.&nbsp; Anything colorful that transforms a dull caricature into an intriguing one.<br /></div>

Perhaps...<br /><br />&quot;Joined by a troublesome nephew he barely knows, a womanizing trucker drives cross country to reconcile with his estranged son – but the nephew has other plans.&quot;<br /><br />That little kicker opens the door to CONFLICT.&nbsp; We get it: this won&#039;t be a tearful coming of age story where the father mentors the nephew and in doing so heals his own fragile relationship with his estranged son.&nbsp; No, in this LL revision it&#039;s about the father&#039;s physical and psychological struggle with the nephew.&nbsp; Maybe the out-of-control nephew plays Devil&#039;s Advocate, tempting the father back to the dark side, further and further from the path that will see him reconciled with the son he always disappoints. All due apologies to Dan Stoller if I turned his sensitive and poignant road movie into THE HITCHER.<br /><br />Note too how being specific about how the trucker&#039;s self-destructive tendencies manifest (&quot;womanizing&quot;) gives us a clue to why his son is estranged.<br /></div>

The action begins after an apocalyptic event that saps the humanity from most of the mutated humans that remain. At its core, it’s the story of a mother wolf, separated from her mate as the rest of the pack flees to safety, is forced to defend her cubs from the oncoming swarm.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ROAD TO OZ - hmmm<br />Josh Golden <br /><br /><b>The early days of brilliant, whimsical author L. Frank Baum, who gave the world The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. </b><br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/temple.gif)<br /><br />It is what it is: another biographical logline. &nbsp;Correction: this isn&#039;t a logline; it&#039;s a premise. &nbsp;A sandbox. &nbsp;Maybe the sandbox contains an exquisite sand castle. &nbsp;Maybe the sandbox holds a series of monotonous peaks and troughs, featureless and windswept like the Sahara Desert. &nbsp;We have to take it on faith that it&#039;s the former, on account of this popular screenplay turning up on the Black List. &nbsp;But what about before it gained notoriety? &nbsp;What convinced the early adopters to read it? &nbsp;Presented with this logline only, why would they choose to read this script over others with much harder working loglines?<br /><br />“Famous person. &nbsp;Read me!” is the gist of biographical loglines like this one. &nbsp;I don&#039;t believe you get a free pass when you base your script on the famous. &nbsp;In fact, I believe you must work harder to build a logline that showcases how your screenplay is different to other biographical screenplays based on that famous subject.<br /><br />Extrapolating from ROAD TO OZ&#039;s logline, we might suppose Josh&#039;s story goes like this: Baum has a wonderful childhood guided by loving parents and family. &nbsp;He educates himself and gathers a coterie of loyal, supportive friends along the way. &nbsp;He decides he will be a writer. &nbsp;Money is no trouble because his father is rich and supportive. &nbsp;Baum woos a beautiful woman and they wed with the blessings of each family. &nbsp;A week after their honeymoon Baum&#039;s literary agent notifies him about an intense bidding war among publishers for the rights to his WIZARD OF OZ manuscript. &nbsp;Baum is now independently wealthy. &nbsp;His wife gives birth to healthy twins, then more children, each a prodigy in their own way and destined to thrive in the world. &nbsp;Baum&#039;s OZ book sells out with every printing and he becomes known and beloved the world over. &nbsp;After a life full of prosperity, good fortune and contentment, Baum dies peacefully in Hollywood in the year 1919. &nbsp;At his funeral attended by famous celebrities, rulers, and influential persons the likes of which have never assembled since, a 22-year-old Shirley Temple approaches Baum&#039;s open coffin. &nbsp;If any mourners recognized her – an impossibility unless they too were time travelers and had skipped forward in time past Shirley Temple&#039;s birth in 1928 – those mourners would recall how in 1950 Temple announced her retirement from acting and had immediately disappeared from public view. &nbsp;Those mourners would know <i>this</i> Shirley Temple – the one right now respectfully approaching Baum&#039;s coffin – was likely an agent of C.R.O.N.E, that shadowy agency with the baffling title of Chrono-temporal Response Organization of New Earth. &nbsp;They would suddenly understand Shirley Temple&#039;s “retirement” in 1950 was nothing of the sort. &nbsp;It had been a recruitment. &nbsp;C.R.O.N.E must have kept its eye on Temple for years, waiting for the right moment to bring her under their wing and reveal to her the true nature of mankind&#039;s twisted history. &nbsp;And now, here in 1919, in this cemetery, on this sunny Los Angeles day, if any mourners were to recognize 22-year-old Shirley Temple they would realize she was here to do one thing and only one thing: bring L. Frank Baum back from the dead...<br /><br />Okay. &nbsp;Before I took one step too many, lost my footing, and plunged into the Abyss, I was making a point about how this logline fails to set up any dramatic through-line. &nbsp;The screenplay&#039;s on the goddamn Black List! &nbsp;There must be a gripping story in there somewhere. &nbsp;We have to assume Baum faces all kinds of adversity and ill fortune within those script pages. &nbsp;He must have dreams and desires and fears. &nbsp;The logline could be a sneak preview of that. &nbsp;Pick one of the adversities – a big one – and thread it into the logline.<br /><br />“The early days of brilliant, whimsical author L. Frank Baum, who gave the world The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, then died, then lived, then became a legendary agent of C.R.O.N.E.”<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A GARDEN AT THE END OF THE WORLD - good<br />Gary Graham<br /><br /><b>In a post-apocalyptic world, a recluse, trying to recreate trees to produce new life, takes in a young girl who is on the run from some bad men, including her father.</b><br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/tree.jpg)<br /><br />A clear sense of setting and genre. &nbsp;A strong setup with clear goals for protag and antag – opposing goals that cannot avoid crashing head on, leading inevitably to a final showdown between tree farmer and the runaway&#039;s father. &nbsp;I really like this logline&#039;s simplicity.<br /><br />Phrased as it is, there&#039;s ambiguity about whether her father is with the “bad men” or whether he&#039;s pursuing her separately in his capacity as just another bad man. &nbsp;I&#039;ll assume the father is with the others – in fact, he&#039;s their leader. &nbsp;Solid drama there.<br /><br />“A recluse trying to restart tree growth in a post-apocalyptic world takes in a young girl on the run from bad men led by her father.”<br /><br />If that&#039;s too exhausting without commas, we can slow it down.<br /><br />“A recluse, working to restart tree growth in a post-apocalyptic world, takes in a young girl on the run from bad men led by her father.”<br /><br />Comfortably under 30 words now.&nbsp; With or without the changes, the logline does its one job well.</div>

Ingrid Bergman and war photographer Robert Capa engage in a passionate, life-changing romance in post-World War II Paris.</b><br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/capa.jpg)<br /><br />The famous subjects plus the period plus the foreboding use of “life-changing” keeps this LL interesting. &nbsp;Once again we must strip off the bubble wrap in order to see the logline clearly:<br /><br />“Ingrid Bergman and war photographer Robert Capa engage in a passionate, life-changing romance in post-World War II Paris.”<br /><br />An accurate description, I do not doubt. &nbsp;However, here is the novel&#039;s plot summary from Wikipedia:<br /><br />“The novel opens in 1945. France is recently liberated by Allied Forces. Robert Capa has photographed the Normandy Landings and been parachuted into Germany. Now he is kicking his heels in Paris, waiting for something to happen. As a dare, he slips a note under the door of Ingrid Bergman’s room at the Ritz, inviting her for a drink. The flirtation escalates quickly into a passionate affair. Ingrid has a husband, child and career back in Hollywood. Capa can’t escape from his traumatic memories of the war or his addiction to the adrenaline high that he only gets from his work. Against his better judgement, Capa follows Ingrid to California, but both still have painful choices to make.”<br /><br />That&#039;s a magnificent one-paragraph synopsis. &nbsp;Again, the LL:<br /><br />“Ingrid Bergman and war photographer Robert Capa engage in a passionate, life-changing romance in post-World War II Paris.”<br /><br />To me, this is like seeing a “beware of the dog” sign posted outside a zoo&#039;s Russian Black Bear enclosure: there&#039;s a befuddling disparity between the two. &nbsp;Why not work into the logline some of that conflict and struggle we know the story possesses...<br /><br />“In post-World War II Paris, movie star Ingrid Bergman and danger-addicted war photographer Robert Capa make passionate, life-changing love, despite her career, child, and husband.”<br /><br />There we go. &nbsp;Twenty-eight words, and now we&#039;ve exposed some of the obstacles they&#039;ll face. &nbsp;Our headline characters are no longer just names on a marquee.<br /><br /><br />THREE loglines to go.</div>

What goes for movies also goes for loglines: the worst sin of all is being boring.<br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/aliens.jpg)<br /></div>
