					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">L.A Time via Playlist -<br /><br />Bad Santa 2 -- Producers on the movie and Dimension Films, which is developing a follow-up to the beloved 2003 black comedy with the newly constituted Miramax, have quietly hired writers to begin working on a new film for Thornton to star in, according to a person who was briefed on the project but was not authorized to talk about it publicly.<br /><br />And here&#039;s the hook: <b>The companies are engaging in the unusual move of commissioning two different writers, with the idea of choosing between the scripts or even using one script for &quot;Bad Santa 2&quot;</b> and the other script for a third film. (The two writers do know about each other.) A spokeswoman for Dimension Films confirmed the hires and the plans.The movie is being produced by Geyer Koskini,Thornton&#039;s manager who produced the original and has been developing the sequel for several years.<br /><br />The scribes in question are up-and-comers who&#039;ve yet to have a film produced but who have some heat in Hollywood. <b>One, Johnny Rosenthal, wrote a period adventure called &quot;Iron Jack&quot;</b> that sold to Sony for more than $1 million&nbsp; in 2009 but has been stuck in development since.<br /><br /><b>The other, John Phillips, sold an R-rated comedy to Universal a few months back. That project is called &quot;Dirty Grandpa&quot;</b> and is about a &quot;recently widowed, sexually aggressive grandfather,&quot; which sounds about as &quot;Bad Santa&quot;-ish as you can get.<br /><br />http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/07/bad-santa-2-sequel-billy-bob-thornton-willie-stokes-dimension.html</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not a bad idea in my opinion.&nbsp; After listening to the writers of Bad Santa speak in Nashville I kind of think their script wouldn&#039;t have been nearly as good if the producer&#039;s hadn&#039;t been the Coen brothers.&nbsp; They talked about a few different instances where the Coen&#039;s told them to change one word or two and it would make all the difference.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are the Coen&#039;s the secret that took that film from just another christmas dud to being a yearly watch?&nbsp; </div>
