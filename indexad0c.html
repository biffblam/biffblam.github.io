					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Heidi Stevens at the Chicago Tribune discusses (http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/life/ct-tribu-words-work-that-20130220,0,4792270.story) the fors and againsts of &quot;that.&quot;<br /><br />I like to kill &#039;em everywhere and resurrect them only where the removal harms clarity and comprehension. &nbsp;Strip the slacker words from your sentences. &nbsp;On the page, every word has a job. &nbsp;Every word contributes or goes home.<br /><br />The Associated Press Style book advises:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">There are no hard-and-fast rules, but in general:<br /><br />- That usually may be omitted when a dependent clause immediately follows a form of the verb to say: The president said he had signed the bill.<br /><br />- That should be used when a time element intervenes between the verb and the dependent clause: The president said Monday that he had signed the bill.<br /><br />- That usually is necessary after some verbs. They include: advocate, assert, contend, declare, estimate, make clear, point out, propose and state.<br /><br />- That is required before subordinate clauses beginning with conjunctions such as after, although, because, before, in addition to, until and while: Haldeman said that after he learned of Nixon&#039;s intention to resign, he sought pardons for all connected with Watergate.<br /><br />When in doubt, include &#039;that.&#039; Omission can hurt. Inclusion never does.<br /></div><br />Here&#039;s a clear example from a 10PTT I hope to publish, unless the writer sells his spec before I get the go-ahead.<br /><br />&quot;Brennan notices that HIS GUN IS POINTED AT HER.&quot;<br /><br />Do we lose anything by removing &quot;that&quot;?<br /><br />&quot;Brennan notices HIS GUN IS POINTED AT HER.&quot;<br /><br />No. &nbsp;Same meaning. &nbsp;And now the sentence reads subtly faster.<br /><br />To test for validity, take the independent clause and shunt it to the front: &quot;HIS GUN IS POINTED AT HER, Brennan notices.&quot; &nbsp;Yep, still makes sense.<br /><br />We can speed comprehension further, if you care to step into the nit-picky world I live in. &nbsp;I don&#039;t just look for words to erase; I look for multi-syllabic words I can pound down to one or two syllables. &nbsp;Crazy, right? &nbsp;No it isn&#039;t, not here in Grammarnia, where a simple run-on sentence earns you a day&#039;s &quot;reeducation&quot; in the gulag.<br /><br />&quot;Brennan notices HIS GUN POINTED AT HER.&quot; &nbsp;Boom. &nbsp;One word gone.<br /><br />Is there a difference between that and:<br /><br />&quot;Brennan notices HIS GUN POINTS AT HER.&quot; &nbsp;I considered this because it knocks off one syllable, and it feels more immediate, more present tense.<br /><br />Yes, there&#039;s a small difference. &nbsp;&quot;HIS GUN POINTS AT HER&quot; could be an action taking place RIGHT NOW instead of a completed action. &nbsp;In other words, it introduces ambiguity. &nbsp;Unlikely, sure, but you can&#039;t entirely dispute that possible interpretation of the text. &nbsp;So we keep &quot;POINTED AT HER.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Notices&quot; is a three-syllable cost, but I can&#039;t think of a shorter word with the same connotation of realization. &quot;Sees&quot; doesn&#039;t quite do it.<br /><br />Reviewing:<br /><br />&quot;Brennan notices that HIS GUN IS POINTED AT HER.&quot;<br />&quot;Brennan notices HIS GUN POINTED AT HER.&quot;<br /><br />We can strip another syllable with:<br /><br />&quot;Brennan notices HIS GUN AIMED AT HER.&quot;<br /><br />Note the independent clause shift from &quot;HIS GUN IS POINTED AT HER&quot; to &quot;Brennan notices HIS GUN.&quot; &nbsp;That&#039;s due to omitting &quot;IS.&quot;<br /><br />Also note, we can take the original &quot;Brennan notices that HIS GUN IS POINTED AT HER&quot; and slice it neatly into two sentences:<br /><br />&quot;HIS GUN IS POINTED AT HER. &nbsp;Brennan notices.&quot;<br /><br />See how &quot;that&quot; falls away naturally. &nbsp;And it suggests a reverse order of shots: CLOSE ON THE GUN; CLOSE ON BRENNAN NOTICING.<br /><br />Final review:<br /><br />&quot;Brennan notices that HIS GUN IS POINTED AT HER.&quot;<br />&quot;Brennan notices HIS GUN AIMED AT HER.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Nutty. &nbsp;Just freakin&#039; nutty. &nbsp;No sane writer will agonize this much over an innocuous, short sentence. &nbsp;But we can agree about the small improvement from losing &quot;that.&quot; &nbsp;Apply this kind of analysis to your longer sentences and that&#039;s where you&#039;ll find the real benefits.<br /><br />UPDATE: Ready for round 2?&nbsp; Of course you are (http://10ptt.com/smf/index.php?topic=398.0).</div>
