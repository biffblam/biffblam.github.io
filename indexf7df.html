							<div class="post">BLANK meets BLANK -- (facepalm). &nbsp;If development execs want us to treat them like retarded children, fine by me. &nbsp;They set the rules. &nbsp;BLANK meets BLANK (meets BLANK) is simple conjuring slight of hand:<br /><br />&quot;In my left hand I have the script for DIE HARD. &nbsp;In my right hand, hidden behind my back, I have my script, which I assure you is DIE HARD IN A LIGHTHOUSE. &nbsp;But here&#039;s the trick: you won&#039;t know if mine really is DIE HARD IN A LIGHTHOUSE until you read it. &nbsp;And the moment you pick it up I&#039;ve already won. &nbsp;I suckered you into reading it. &nbsp;I promised you DIE HARD IN A LIGHTHOUSE but I gave you JAWS MEETS DRIVING MISS DAISY MEETS TRANSFORMERS.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, here are the loglines that caught my eye.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">THE LEONARDO JOB<br />Logline: Two thieves who are hired to steal the only previously unseen DaVinci fresco are double crossed by who they think is the Italian femme fatale they’ve both fallen for. However, after learning another thief is after it, they redeem themselves by beating him to his plans and donating the piece to the girl, her dying father figure, and the museum of Florence.<br /></div><br />How not to write a logline. &nbsp;DON&#039;T GIVE AWAY THE ENDING.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">THE MONEY TREE<br />Logline: Story follows a family on the verge of foreclosure who discover what happens when money really does grow on trees.<br /></div><br />High concept. &nbsp;Gives no hint at what direction the story follows -- save for paying off the mortgage -- but the premise intrigues so much that I&#039;d read it just to see if the writers fulfil the story potential. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">FIRELINE<br />Logline: Living in a van, surviving on selling t-shirts and surfing every chance he gets, Noah Fischer (20) doesn’t have a family or much contact with people, but when he is convicted of a crime he never intended to commit, he’s sent up to Northern California to serve out his sentence fighting forest fires. It is here that Noah will learn how to count on others, how to battle the most intense of blazes, and maybe even find the home he never knew he wanted.<br /></div><br />For me, the logline works until the end, where the wheels fall off. &quot;Maybe even find the home he never knew he wanted.&quot; Gag. &nbsp;But the LL does promise fire-fighting action, scope for plenty of conflict, and a character arc. &nbsp;I&#039;d read it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">SCAVENGERS<br />Logline: Three estranged brothers discover that in order to collect their inheritance, they will have to go out on a scavenger hunt to find treasure left behind by their adventurous father after his death.<br /></div><br />Writes itself, yeah? &nbsp;Good LL. &nbsp;Sets up the premise then lets your mind run wild thinking of the directions it might go. &nbsp;Three brothers battling it out from the start, with a life lesson waiting for all. &nbsp;A promise of action and adventure with a feel-good finish. &nbsp;Definitely a read.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">NEVERLAND<br />Logline: A dark twist on the classic “Peter Pan” tale, in which Pan is a villain, kidnapping all of London’s kids to mine his island for the precious faerie dust that keeps him young, and Captain Hook is a young man, who must steal a ship and sail to Neverland to battle Pan, save the children, and free his imprisoned girlfriend.<br /></div><br />A simple story reversal, and an intriguing one. &nbsp;The task: make Pan the villain and Hook the hero. &nbsp;Who doesn&#039;t want to see if the writers pull that off? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">THE SLACKFI PROJECT (READ)<br />Logline: A hapless and broken hearted barrista is visited by two bad-ass soldiers from the future who tell him mankind is doomed unless he alone can save them.<br /></div><br />I&#039;m assuming this is comedy. &nbsp;You know a LL works when you read it and immediately begin to imagine dialogue and situations.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">ZOMBIE PET SHOP (READ)<br />Logline: When a mysterious plague sweeps through a mall pet shop, turning all of the animals into zombies, an ordinary pug named Joey must come to the rescue to find the antidote that will save his four-legged friends, as well as the humans that might take them home.<br /></div><br />A fresh twist on the zombie genre. &nbsp;Animals. &nbsp;Sooooo cute. &nbsp;Zombie animals. Ewwwwww... awwwww, still mostly cute. &nbsp;GAAAAAAHHHHH, my ankle! &nbsp;Awww, how can I stay mad at you with that fuzzy, grizzled face and those big, wet, bloodshot eyes...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">VOICES FROM THE DEAD (N/A)<br />Logline: Follows the friendship between magician Harry Houdini and mystery author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as they team up with a psychic to solve a series of bizarre murders in 1920s New York.<br />Writer: J. Michael Straczynski<br /></div><br />&#039;Nuf said. &nbsp;Houdini, Doyle, Straczynski -- three brilliant minds working together to blow yours. &nbsp;I&#039;m rooting for this like crazy. &nbsp;Straczynski deserves a massive hit. &nbsp;His serious film work is nice, but this... this screams FUN. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">THE NANA IN ME (READ)<br />Logline: After a teenage boy is possessed by his dead grandmother, the two team up to make him a cool kid in school and to rectify her estranged relationship with her daughter.<br /></div><br />A teenage boy possessed by his dead grandmother. &nbsp;BOOM. &nbsp;I don&#039;t need to read any more. &nbsp;I&#039;m there. &nbsp;The two team up to make him a cool kid in school? &nbsp;That I&#039;m not so thrilled about. &nbsp;When your dead grandmother shares your body something damn exciting better happen.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">THE DISENGAGEMENT (READ)<br />Logline: When David accidentally proposes to his best friend, Olivia, she surprises him by saying “yes,” revealing that she’s always secretly been in love with him. Now, David is engaged to the wrong girl and in desperate need of a way out!<br /></div><br />Simple high concept. &nbsp;You propose to the wrong woman and can&#039;t take it back. &nbsp;Another clever logline that feeds you the hook and lets your mind go crazy chewing on it. &nbsp;The risk with loglines like this is, you must deliver on your story promise. &nbsp;You&#039;re screwed if the reader comes up with a better idea than you did.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">UNPLUGGED (READ)<br />Logline: After a freak accident, a technologically reliant businessman finds himself faced with a new reality: No matter where he goes, all electronics around him cease to work.<br /></div><br />Another simple but intriguing hook. &nbsp;We get no hint of the protag&#039;s personal problem, but I&#039;d read this to see if the writers pay off.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">ROSE RED (READ)<br />Logline: Pitched as “Tangled” meets “Princess Bride”, the story tells the tale of Rose Red – Snow White’s tomboy sister, who though having a strained relationship with her sister, was responsible for getting her Prince to kiss Snow White and save her life.<br /></div><br />Another good twist/angle on a well known tale. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the latter half of the LL causes confusion. &nbsp;Is the tale of Rose Red, Snow White&#039;s estranged tomboy sister, who must get the Prince to kiss Snow White and save her life, or is this story about Rose Red and her sister Snow White AFTER the kiss that changed everything?<br /></div>
