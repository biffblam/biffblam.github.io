					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">UPDATE: Go here (http://10ptt.com/smf/index.php?topic=330.0) to witness the first time I told THAT to get off my lawn.<br /><br />-----<br />My problem with &quot;that&quot; is that it&#039;s overused.<br /><br />My problem with &quot;that&quot; is it&#039;s overused.<br />-----<br /><br />Seeing them side by side, it&#039;s obvious, right?<br /><br />Why do we allow &quot;that&quot; to stink up our sentences? &nbsp;Most of the time it does nothing helpful. &nbsp;Most of the time it sits there thumbing its nose at readability.<br /><br />Every day I see &quot;that&quot; littering every form of writing. &nbsp;I expect nobody gives it any thought. &nbsp;Just one of those forgettable words <del>that</del> we use to connect one part of a sentence to another.<br /><br />No. &nbsp;It&#039;s time to wake up to &quot;that.&quot; &nbsp;Today we take the red pill. &nbsp;I&#039;m here to make you give a damn. &nbsp;Because I do. &nbsp;That [correct use] I seriously do.<br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/tumblr_lzq2ditaon1r066zfo1_500.gif)<br /><br />Pocahontas needs no &quot;that&quot; to make her point and neither do you.<br /><br />So, what is &quot;that&quot;?<br /><br />This (http://www.dictionary.com/browse/that?s=t) is &quot;that.&quot; &nbsp;Take a look at the examples listed on that [correct use] dictionary page. &nbsp;They&#039;re printed in grey italics. &nbsp;In almost every case you cannot remove &quot;that&quot; because the word is functional. &nbsp;Remove it and the sentence meaning shifts perceptibly or falls apart entirely. &nbsp;I see only one opportunity to remove &quot;that&quot; and claim no harm done:<br /><br />-----<br />4. (used as the subject or object of a relative clause, especially one defining or restricting the antecedent, sometimes replaceable by who, whom, or which):<br /><br /><i>the horse that he bought.</i><br />-----<br /><br />We don&#039;t know the context. &nbsp;Are we discussing the horse and the goat and the cow that he bought? &nbsp;Are we dealing with two horses: the horse he bought and the horse he got for free? &nbsp;Are we talking about the horse that HE bought and not the horse that the other guy bought? (Rephrasing: Are we talking about the horse HE bought and not the horse the other guy bought?)<br /><br />If we need to &quot;define or restrict the antecedent,&quot; if we need specificity and clarification then, okay, it&#039;s &quot;the horse that he bought.&quot; &nbsp;Otherwise there&#039;s no reason we can&#039;t use &quot;the horse he bought.&quot; &nbsp;There is no confusion in that context.<br /><br />Particularly irksome to me is the proliferation of &quot;that&quot; in TV and movie dialogue. &nbsp;It might look okay on the page, and it might sound okay out of the mouth of a good actor -- they know how to hide bad dialogue. &nbsp;Mostly it sounds like what it is: an actor speaking a line from a script by a writer oblivious to how people talk. &nbsp;Listen carefully to the next movie trailer on Youtube. &nbsp;Replay the spoken lines containing &quot;that&quot; but now omit the word. &nbsp;Does it sound more natural or less?<br /><br />Here&#039;s what got me mad enough to post on the subject.<br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screenshot-030516-233458-that.png)<br /><br /><br />That last one -- &quot;My superpower is that I move through the world without skin&quot; -- is arguably correct usage. &nbsp;But it still works just fine without &quot;that.&quot; &nbsp;If not replacing &quot;that&quot; with punctuation scares you, no problem:<br /><br />&quot;My superpower is: I move through the world without skin.&quot;<br />&quot;My superpower: I move through the world without skin.&quot;<br />&quot;My superpower is, I move through the world without skin.&quot;<br /><br />While I&#039;m focused on this &quot;superpower&quot; example, I&#039;ll prissily point out some accidental ambiguity. &nbsp;The author intends to say (I assume) &quot;My superpower is I move without skin through the world&quot; -- i.e. the author has no skin. &nbsp;But you can read it as saying the world is the thing without skin, that the world has no barrier (skin).<br /><br />That&#039;s right, folks. &nbsp;I&#039;m THAT obsessed with language. &nbsp;Next time I offer, TAKE THE DAMN BLUE PILL.</div>
