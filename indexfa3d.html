					Title: <b>We Painted the Wall With Cracks</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Writers learn a special kind of ESP called Enhanced Sentence Parsing. &nbsp;We must be attuned to a long roster of grammatical maladies. &nbsp; Near the top of the list is the affliction of ambiguous meaning.<br /><br />&quot;We painted the walls with cracks.&quot;<br />More here (http://www.fun-with-words.com/ambiguous_garden_path.html).<br /><br />We mean (probably): &quot;We painted the cracked walls.&quot; &nbsp;But we did not say what we mean. &nbsp;We allowed ambiguity to seep into our sentence and it split the road of readability in two. &nbsp;Like any fork in the road, we must stop in our tracks and figure out which route we&#039;re supposed to take. &nbsp;Any time a reader slams on the brakes because what you wrote was unclear, you&#039;ve failed your core competency. &nbsp;You have one job, dear Writer: keep the reader reading.<br /><br />The first path demands a literal interpretation: we painted cracks onto the walls. &nbsp;Ridiculous, you say? &nbsp;Let me add context. &nbsp;We&#039;re painting a backdrop for a cheap horror movie. &nbsp;The backdrop is a dirty gray cement wall. &nbsp;The director asked us to make it look more ancient, more damaged. &nbsp;So we painted the &quot;wall&quot; with &quot;cracks.&quot; &nbsp;More accurately, we painted the <i>prop</i> wall with cracks. &nbsp;That one extra word (&quot;prop&quot;) blocks the second road with a detour sign hung with flashing yellow lights and we have no choice but swerve left and continue along the first road.<br /><br />The second path of comprehension is the intended one: the walls had cracks so we painted over them. &nbsp;We painted the cracked walls.<br /><br />Sometimes we practice ambiguity to keep the reader in suspense or for some other intended dramatic purpose. &nbsp;Most times it&#039;s an unwelcome, uninvited, disruptive guest.<br /><br />I&#039;ll record examples in this topic. &nbsp;Here&#039;s the first.<br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/sinatra.jpg)<br /><br />CAPTION: &quot;Frank getting dressed before a performance in his hotel room at the Eden Roc in Miami, 1965.&quot;<br /><br />- source (http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/12/frank-sinatra-final-concert-gregg-field-drummer)<br /><br />The caption permits two legitimate interpretations:<br /><br />(1) We see Frank dressing. &nbsp;He&#039;s about to give a private performance in his Eden Roc hotel room -- maybe for a small group of very special guests.<br /><br />(2) We see Frank dressing in his hotel room. &nbsp;He&#039;s about to leave and perform at some big venue in Miami Beach.<br /><br />To eliminate the first interpretation we need only rearrange the sentence:<br /><br />CAPTION: &quot;Frank dressing in his hotel room at the Eden Roc in Miami before a performance, 1965.&quot;<br /><br />Applying the golden rule to always anchor your reader in time and space at the start of a sentence:<br /><br />CAPTION: &quot;Frank in his hotel room at the Eden Roc in Miami, 1965, getting ready to perform.&quot;<br /><br />We might include the performance venue to rule out the possibility he&#039;s about to perform at the hotel&#039;s own venue.<br /><br />CAPTION: &quot;Frank in his hotel room at the Eden Roc, 1965, getting ready to perform at the Miami Arts Arena.&quot;<br /><br />Well, as it turns out (http://miamiarchives.blogspot.com.au/2014/06/frank-sinatra-at-eden-roc-1964-1965.html), he WAS performing in the Eden Roc hotel*. &nbsp;Now we can remove all ambiguity from the caption. &nbsp;The two facts we want to convey are:<br /><br />(a) Frank pictured in his room at the Eden Roc hotel.<br />(b) Frank getting ready to perform at the Eden Roc hotel.<br /><br />So:<br /><br />CAPTION: &quot;Frank dressing in his hotel room at the Eden Roc in Miami, 1965, where he was performing.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />* FEBRUARY 1â€“14, 1965: Frank headlined with his old friend Joe E. Lewis in a two-week stand at the Eden Roc Hotel in Miami.<br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/edenroc.png)</div>
