					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Re: Slugs and Action<br /><br />Evening,<br /><br />I am both a newbie to forums and a novice in screenwriting.&nbsp; If the latter is obvious perhaps someone will kindly point it out.&nbsp; What a delight being able to communicate with real like-minded souls for a change. <br />My work on the near-completed first 10 pages of the rewrite of one of my screenplays has once again come to a screeching halt - this time due to contradictory information given by some online screenwriting sources regarding slugs and action. <br />I have just discovered&nbsp; &quot;... if it&#039;s in the slug, lose it in the action&quot; (as in Splendora by Hudson Phillips, I believe) - this is the opposite to some of the online formats that I have been adhering to.&nbsp; Since I much prefer Mr Phillips&#039; way and before I go back to the Fade in to alter all accordingly, the following are 3 versions of a scene on page 3 of my current rewrite:<br /><br />1. EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT<br />Tightly parked vehicles swamp the side street.&nbsp; Despite his injuries, Yardstick hurls himself down (it?).&nbsp; Laboured thud of size thirteen steel toe cap Doc Marten boots.&nbsp; No hiding place.&nbsp; Yardstick freezes.<br /><br />2.EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT<br />Injured, Yardstick hurls himself down the side street swamped with vehicles parked tight.&nbsp; Laboured thud of size thirteen steel toe cap Doc Marten boots.&nbsp; No hiding place ...<br /><br />3. EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT <br />Swamped with vehicles parked tight.&nbsp; Yardstick - beaten up - forces himself down the side street.&nbsp; Laboured thud of size thirteen steel toe cap Doc Marten boots ...<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br />Best,<br />Infamous.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&gt;&gt; 3. EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT <br />Swamped with vehicles parked tight.&nbsp; Yardstick - beaten up - forces himself down the side street.&nbsp; Laboured thud of size thirteen steel toe cap Doc Marten boots <br /><br /><br />I like that one.&nbsp; It hinges off the slug, eliminating repetition.&nbsp; One problem: in all of the examples, I&#039;m unsure if the &quot;laboured thud&quot; applies to his own boots or those of his presumed pursuers.&nbsp; Given &quot;laboured&quot;, I&#039;ll go with the former.&nbsp; I wonder if putting the sound cue first makes a stronger connection, i.e. switch sentence three and two.<br /><br />You could lose the EXT if this is part of a chase sequence.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not a shooting draft then you can slug as sparsely as you like, so long as there&#039;s no ambiguity or confusion.&nbsp; Thinner slugs make for a faster read.&nbsp; Up to personal taste.</div>
