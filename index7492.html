					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div align="center">(https://10ptt.com/smf/10ptt_shake.gif)</div><br /><br /><b>MONROE&#039;S CABARET by Carl Johnson</b><br />(pages used with author&#039;s permission)<br /><br /><br />Thanks to Carl Johnson for permission to conduct this 10PTT on MONROE&#039;S CABARET. &nbsp;As tradition dictates I ignore dialogue, which is a good thing because dialogue and I cross the street to avoid each other. &nbsp;No, we&#039;re here to flagellate description only.<br /><br />Standard disclaimer: I don&#039;t claim my revisions are “correct” or “right”. &nbsp;In some cases my revisions are likely not even “good.” &nbsp;They&#039;re simply mine – changes that were right for me, right now.<br /><br />While this draft feels too stiffly written and overly narrator-ish, isolating us from the characters – ironically enough like the glass wall that incites the story – I like the two brothers and I want to know more about their strained relationship. &nbsp;Relationships are crucial. Stories are nothing but character relationships that change over time, change through conflict. &nbsp;I challenge you to not feel curious about Leonard, his sensitivity, his brutishness, and his dumbassery. &nbsp;He&#039;s an underdog I can get behind. &nbsp;My favorite moment in these pages is Leonard – having improvised an alternate plan to blow up rival Julian&#039;s taxi cab rather than cut the brake lines – gets knocked on his ass by the WHOMPING explosion everyone saw coming but him. &nbsp;He&#039;s lying dazed on his back in the snow, gazing up at the star-glittering night sky...<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Leonard gets blown on his ass!<br /><br />FRANCIS: Jesus Christ!<br /><br />A high-pitched SCREAM comes from inside Julian&#039;s house.<br /><br />Francis runs to Leonard&#039;s side as Julian&#039;s cab burns.<br /><br />On his back in the deep snow, Leonard stares in awe at the brilliant and infinite stars blanketing the night sky.<br /><br />LEONARD: It&#039;s so beautiful!<br /><br />The lights go on in Julian&#039;s house...<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I love that disconnected epiphany. &nbsp;It&#039;s a character moment actors live for. &nbsp;The CU of Leonard&#039;s stunned, slack face; the dampened ringing of his concussed eardrums; Leonard blinking, blinking, eyes suddenly dilating as he sees, really sees that sparkling void of night and the childlike wonder floods in; and we CUT TO that magnificent speckled blackness and we agree before Leonard says so that, yes, the sky at night is a truly awesome thing.<br /><br />And away we go.<br /><br /></div>

BAUDETTE CITY HALL - BATHROOM - NIGHT<br /><br />FRANCIS MONROE (32) stares solemnly into the mirror while he washes his hands with great care.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MONROE (V.O.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Good evening, Mayor and council members...<br />-----<br /><br />If the running water is important, make it so, e.g. with a mini slug:<br /><br />-----<br />SOAPY HANDS UNDER A FAUCET<br /><br />FRANCIS MONROE (32) stares intently into the mirror, rinsing his already clean hands.<br />-----<br /><br />How he washes his hands -- &quot;with great care&quot;, &quot;meticulously&quot;, &quot;thoroughly&quot; -- can tell us something about his personality.<br /><br /><br />2.<br /><br />Is it important he be exactly 32?&nbsp; It might be if this is a biography of a famous person.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell yet if it&#039;s the case here.&nbsp; If it isn&#039;t important then use &quot;early 30s&quot; to widen the field of actors who can play this part. <br /><br />&quot;Slight build, sharp eyes&quot; sounds a bit on-the-nose.&nbsp; All main characters have &quot;sharp eyes&quot; it seems.&nbsp; It&#039;s a generic descriptive term that adds nothing.&nbsp; Let his actions and speech define him.<br /><br /><br />3.<br /><br />&quot;He&#039;s tense&quot; is typical passive/declarative sentence.&nbsp; This is textbook antithesis &quot;show, don&#039;t tell.&quot;&nbsp; See the above revisions where we let his stare show us he&#039;s feeling tense.&nbsp; The overwashing of hands is another indicator.&nbsp; Find the telltale signs and present them.&nbsp; &quot;Something is something&quot; only encourages the reader to tune out.&nbsp; Tuning out is the natural human response when we face a task that requires nothing from us.&nbsp; The mind wants to be challenged and stimulated.&nbsp; That won&#039;t happen if we&#039;re constantly telling, not showing.<br /><br /><br />3b.<br /><br />Why is it important to say it&#039;s a laminate desk?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what &quot;laminate&quot; tells us about Harrison.&nbsp; If we&#039;re meant to understand this is a fancy table them say so.&nbsp; If we&#039;re mean to understand this is a plain, modest desk then say so.&nbsp; If &quot;laminate&quot; adds nothing to our understanding then leave it out.&nbsp; Initially I thought you were contrasting &quot;unpolished&quot; Harrison with his polished desk, but laminate does not mean &quot;polished&quot; -- I checked.&nbsp; Laminate refers to construction in layers.&nbsp; &quot;Laminated&quot; more closely suggests a protective layer of plastic, if that&#039;s what you intended.&nbsp; If in fact you were contrasting unpolished/polished then may as well be direct about it: &quot;Mayor Harrison, 38, unpolished and blue-collar, stoops over the polished veneer of his ornate desk.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />4.&nbsp; Again, these character ages are oddly precise.&nbsp; Is it important they be exactly these ages?<br /><br />&quot;Soft, pale&quot; -- description is a poor cousin to action and dialogue.&nbsp; Being told a character is X and Y prevents reader participation.&nbsp; You&#039;re giving them the answer before you ask the question.&nbsp; &nbsp;But allow the reader to gradually understand a character through that character&#039;s decisions, actions, and dialogue, now you have engaged the reader.&nbsp; You&#039;ve offered them the driver&#039;s seat instead of shoving them into the passenger seat.<br /><br /><br />5. We don&#039;t need to see Leonard seated then moving to stand at the podium.&nbsp; Let&#039;s just begin there.<br /><br />UH OH.&nbsp; As you will have guessed, I&#039;m wrong about Leonard moving to the podium.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not my (the reader&#039;s) fault.&nbsp; &nbsp;You have a major ambiguity working against you here.&nbsp; A particularly bad one.&nbsp; Here&#039;s why.&nbsp; We meet Francis Monroe in the prior scene.&nbsp; In this fresh scene you introduce a new &quot;Monroe&quot;: Leonard Monroe.&nbsp; We do NOT know anything about Francis Monroe being in this scene because you don&#039;t mention him at all.&nbsp; So, when you intro Leonard Monroe then immediately state &quot;Monroe stands at a small podium...&quot; we logically assume you mean Leonard Monroe has left his seat in the public area to stand at the podium.<br /><br />&quot;LEONARD MONROE ... sits in the ... public seating area.&nbsp; Monroe stands at a small podium facing the council.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s a somewhat jarring segue, but because you have not yet mentioned that Francis -- the man we met in the previous scene -- is in this scene too, we must assume there&#039;s only one Monroe present: Leonard.&nbsp; It&#039;s not until a councilman calls him by name (&quot;Francis&quot;) in page 2 that we realize, oh, the Monroe at the podium is Francis from the first scene, not Leonard Monroe from this scene.&nbsp; Confusion!&nbsp; Unfortunately, it&#039;s the kind that derails comprehension and forces your reader to go back and rethink what they just read.<br /><br />You need to tell us early that Francis Monroe is in this scene, and you must be clear at all times about which Monroe we&#039;re dealing with.<br /><br />And you should probably preface dialogue with first names only, or full names: &quot;FRANCIS MONROE&quot;, &quot;LEONARD MONROE&quot;.&nbsp; This will go a long way toward keeping ambiguity at bay.&nbsp; Generally, you&#039;ll use first names for main characters, almost always for the &quot;good guys&quot;, and surnames for the &quot;bad guys&quot; and people performing in official positions.&nbsp; There&#039;s sound psychological reasons for this.&nbsp; First names bring a familiarity and empathy we don&#039;t get with surnames.&nbsp; Surnames imply there&#039;s an emotional barrier between us and them.<br /><br />&quot;Two council members sit to Harrison&#039;s right...&quot; -- I&#039;d avoid the repetition of &quot;council members&quot;.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;d move the spatial references to the start of the sentence, to give the reader those cues immediately.&nbsp; How about...<br /><br /><br />6.<br /><br />-----<br />INT. BAUDETTE CITY HALL - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - NIGHT<br /><br />Francis Monroe stands [nervously? stiffly? relaxed?] at a podium facing THE COUNCIL.<br /><br />Seated behind a long polished-wood desk, with two council members on his left and two on his right, is MAYOR HARRISON, 38, gruff and blue collar.<br /><br />At a folding table adjacent is CLINT DOTAS, 42, a pudgy ghost of a man.<br /><br />Alone in the public seating area sits a prematurely bald man with strong shoulders: LEONARD MONROE, 29.<br />-----<br /><br /><br /><br />7.<br /><br />Again, is it important this be from his rear pocket, not front pocket or side pocket or shirt pocket?&nbsp; Why do we need to be so exact about which pocket?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">8.<br /><br />How?&nbsp; One character looking at another is empty filler unless we get a sense of what the &quot;look&quot; means.&nbsp; We get that on screen, where a &quot;look&quot; can tell us plenty.&nbsp; But on the page it&#039;s just filler.&nbsp; Either cut it and let the dialogue steer the context or make the sentence contribute to the scene:<br /><br />&quot;Harrison frowns at the council member.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Harrison glares at the council member.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Harrison moves quickly to shut down this line of enquiry.&nbsp; HARRISON: That&#039;s not appropriate, Jim.&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">8a.<br /><br />On first read, I thought he might be driving.&nbsp; It&#039;s in the next paragraph you point out the cab is parked.&nbsp; Let&#039;s get this moved up to prevent ambiguity.<br /><br /><br />9.<br /><br />You still haven&#039;t told us what the relationship is between Francis and Leonard.&nbsp; We assume one due to their shared surname.&nbsp; We assume they&#039;re brothers, but until you confirm it on the page it&#039;s only a probability, not a fact.<br /><br /><br />10.<br /><br />Hyphenate.<br /><br />So this whole section becomes, in revision, something like:<br /><br />JULIAN CASETTA, 40, pornstar mustache, sits in his parked Crown Victoria taxi cab combing his greasy black hair and checking himself in the rearview mirror.<br /><br />Outside the open driver&#039;s window, Francis and Leonard shiver in the snow-covered street, talking to Julian over the cab&#039;s engine noise.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">13.<br /><br />&quot;Person X stands here, Person Y stands there.&quot;&nbsp; Be less concerned about characters hitting their marks and more concerned with what they&#039;re doing.&nbsp; What they do defines them, not where they stand.&nbsp; Save the explicit spatial cues for when ambiguity or confusion might arise without them.<br /><br />14.<br /><br />I do like to see spatial cues at the head of sentences to give the reader an immediate point of reference from which to build their mental image, but obviously you don&#039;t want to stick rigidly to that guideline or the writing becomes monotonous. <br /><br /><br />15.<br /><br />&quot;A wall of glass separates Brandi from PATRONS near the stage who slide dollar bills through slots where the raised stage floor meets the glass.&quot;&nbsp; Thirty-seven words down to twenty-five.<br /><br /><br />16.<br /><br />&quot;A few PATRONS&quot; -- we used this exact phrase moments ago in the preceding paragraph.&nbsp; The repetition feels jarring.&nbsp; If the bar is sparsely populated then say so once and be done with it.<br /><br />The chief problem with the original sentence is how it describes a few customers watching Jimmy change TV channels.&nbsp; It&#039;s like watching a man who&#039;s watching paint dry: supremely unexciting.&nbsp; So let&#039;s get through this quiet, sleepy moment as quickly as possible: &quot;Other patrons at the bar watch JIMMY, 50, short and fat, stand on a stool to change channels on an old TV.&quot;&nbsp; Is it important we see Jimmy drag the stool over and clamber onto it, or can we simply cut to him ON THE STOOL already, fiddling with the TV?&nbsp; &quot;Patrons at the bar watch JIMMY, 50s, short and fat, on a stool changing channels on the overhead TV.&quot;<br /><br /><br />17.<br /><br />Context gives you everything already.&nbsp; No need to reiterate what&#039;s already established.&nbsp; The &quot;he converses with Jimmy as he walks past&quot; is especially egregious given it&#039;s all there in the next bit of dialogue.<br /><br /><br />18.<br /><br />Initially I trimmed this sentence to: &quot;Still playing with the TV, Jimmy turns to Monroe.&quot;&nbsp; But even that felt unnecessary.&nbsp; Is it important we know he&#039;s still fiddling with the TV as he replies?&nbsp; I very much doubt it, unless this is planting a plot point for a future pay-off.&nbsp; So let&#039;s just dump it all and let the dialogue play out, with all it implies in the way of actor physical bits.<br /><br /><br />19.<br /><br />We know Leonard is doing bouncer duty on the door, so we can let previous context guide us in this scene and strip it back to bare essentials.<br /><br />&quot;Converses&quot; appears way to much already.&nbsp; Mix it up: talks, speaks, chats, scolds, whispers...<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">21a.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t mark it on the page (bottom of page 8) because it&#039;s an afterthought and it&#039;s stupidly, obsessively, needlessly particular. &nbsp;But hey, this wouldn&#039;t be a 10PTT without at least one bizarre grammatical walkabout.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Leonard nods with excitement as Francis slows the car.<br /><br />JULIAN&#039;S HOUSE<br /><br />Francis pulls the car to the shoulder and kills the headlights and engine.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />We&#039;ve got a clear segue from the prior scene. &nbsp;We don&#039;t need the “Francis pulls the car to the shoulder.” &nbsp;It&#039;s implicit. &nbsp;Francis slows the car. &nbsp;From there he can logically do one of two things: stop the car or accelerate away.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Leonard nods with excitement as Francis slows the car.<br /><br />JULIAN&#039;S HOUSE<br /><br />Francis kills the headlights and engine.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />“Francis kills the headlights and engine.” &nbsp;That offers two interpretations, and both fit the narrative. &nbsp;We know the car is moving slowly, creeping along at this point. &nbsp;We know Francis either pulls to a stop before he kills the engine or he lets the car coast briefly with no lights or power until it rolls to a stop on its own. &nbsp;I like the second reading. &nbsp;It holds more sense of danger, more stealth. &nbsp; If I&#039;m in the Director&#039;s chair, that&#039;s how it&#039;s gonna play. &nbsp;But I think most people wouldn&#039;t give it a second thought; they&#039;d read it as “Francis has stopped the car.”<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">25a.<br /><br />Here&#039;s another unmarked afterthought for top of page 11. &nbsp;“Leonard crouches behind Julian&#039;s cab. &nbsp; He whispers loudly from behind the car.” &nbsp;I have two more notes to add.<br /><br />First, we don&#039;t need two instances of “car”. &nbsp;“Leonard crouches behind Julian&#039;s cab.” &nbsp;Okay, we&#039;re done. &nbsp;We know where Leonard is. &nbsp;If he “whispers loudly” we know where the whisper&#039;s coming from. &nbsp;So:<br /><br />“Leonard crouches behind Julian&#039;s cab. &nbsp; He whisper-shouts to Francis:”<br /><br />Or we can cut the second sentence and put the whisper in a parenthetical:<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Leonard crouches behind Julian&#039;s cab.<br /><br />LEONARD<br />(whisper-shouting)<br />I told you not to make fun of me for being bald.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />It&#039;s a direct response to Francis&#039;s dialogue, so we don&#039;t need further directions about whom he&#039;s addressing. &nbsp;Maybe there&#039;s a better term for it than “whisper-shouting”, but I think it does a good job at suggesting amusingly ineffectual covert conversation.<br /><br />My second afterthought note is this: When Francis gives the all clear, Leonard “walks to the side of Julian&#039;s cab.” Leonard is already crouched behind Julian&#039;s cab. &nbsp;That&#039;s pretty close to the fuel intake. &nbsp;He won&#039;t have to walk far. &nbsp;Maybe two steps? &nbsp;So why include the extra description?<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Leonard crouches behind Julian&#039;s cab...<br /><br />[etc]<br /><br />Leonard opens the fuel door, uncaps the fill spout...<br /><br />-----<br /><br /><br /><br />26.<br /><br />Leonard is physically present in this scene.<br /><br /><br />27.<br /><br />All of this is waaay too wordy for the tiny bit of action it describes. &nbsp;Devote your words to the important parts and speed through the minor stuff. &nbsp;Here&#039;s the spaghetti revision untangled:<br /><br />&quot;Leonard walks to the side of Julian&#039;s cab. &nbsp;He uncaps the fill spout and stuffs the sock in, ignites it with a cigarette lighter and backs away.&quot;<br /><br />This probably flows better written as:<br /><br />&quot;Leonard finds the fuel door on Julian&#039;s cab, uncaps the spout, stuffs the sock in and ignites it with a cigarette lighter, then backs away.&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">29a.<br /><br />Whoops. &nbsp;I omitted the annotation for the final revision: “Leonard turns to Francis with a concerned look.”<br /><br />“Looking concerned [troubled, worried], Leonard turns to Francis.” &nbsp;Or perhaps:<br />“Leonard turns to Francis with concern.”<br />“Leonard turns anxiously to Francis.”<br /><br />But honestly, that whole line can vanish with no dip in comprehension. &nbsp;In fact I prefer it without the narrative interruption. &nbsp;To me it feels funnier simply as:<br /><br />-----<br /><br />FRANCIS: You did good, Lenny. &nbsp;You did real fucking good.<br />LEONARD: I CAN&#039;T HEAR SHIT!<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t Leonard&#039;s panicky line say everything already?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>FINAL COMMENTS</b><br /><br />-- This feels to me like the start of a Coen Brothers movie. &nbsp;I like the loving but discordant relationship between Leonard and Francis. &nbsp;The attack on Julian&#039;s cab is a welcome action/conflict sequence set early in the story to get us hooked.<br /><br />-- You need to let Francis be Francis, not &quot;Monroe&quot;, just like Leonard Monroe is &quot;Leonard&quot;.<br /><br />-- Keep an eye on your verbs. &nbsp;Go for punchy, active verbs. &nbsp;And watch the passive sentences. &nbsp;Flip them around to make them active mostly.<br /><br />-- Skip over the small details, both in describing your characters and describing minor bits of action we can intuit ourselves without being told. &nbsp;Know when to let the established context do the hard work for you.<br /><br /><br />10PTT over and out.<br /></div>
