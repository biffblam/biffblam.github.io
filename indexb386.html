					Title: <b>Does draft-screenplay analysis harm or help?</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Pitchpatch</b> on <b>October 25, 2012, 06:50 AM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A recent discussion (http://johnaugust.com/2012/scriptnotes-ep-55-producers-and-pitching-transcript) by Craig Mazin and John August over at johnaugust.com stuck in my head and gave me a small but prolonged prickle of concern.<br /><br />In their regular podcast, John and Craig honed in on Scriptshadow (http://scriptshadow.blogspot.com.au/) and how that blog&#039;s author, Carson Reeves (pseudonym) harms script development.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><b>John August:</b> So, let&#039;s get into some of our bigger topics here. And this is actually — a couple different listeners sent this in saying like, &quot;Hey, what do you think about this?&quot; And I&#039;m like, oh, I didn&#039;t even want to open the URL when I recognized what it was from, but it&#039;s probably worth talking about.<br /><br />So, there&#039;s a blog called Scriptshadow, and my first interaction with Scriptshadow was when the man who runs the blog, Carson Reeves, had reviewed a project that I was currently rewriting. So he had read the script and written a detailed blog review of this script, this early draft by another writer, and I was the currently employed writer on it. It was, like, a pretty high profile project at that point. And so the studio I was working for went ballistic and got him to pull the review.<br /><br />And that was the end of it, I think, from his perspective. From my perspective, his publishing this review of this other writer&#039;s draft made my life horribly worse, because suddenly I was having to sign all these things about, like, I couldn&#039;t send this script to anybody. I couldn&#039;t show it to my agent. I couldn&#039;t show it to my sort of trusted friends. I could only send it to this one executive. Everything had to be watermarked, and they got super paranoid about this.<br /><br />And in a blog post I wrote up sort of my frustration, and so the blog post was called &quot;Why Scriptshadow hurts screenwriters.&quot; I explained that reviewing a script of a movie that hasn&#039;t shot yet, hasn&#039;t come out yet, is really damaging for both the movie and for screenwriters. It&#039;s damaging for the movie because you&#039;re trying to review something that&#039;s still its fetal form. So you&#039;re pretending that this movie is the way it&#039;s going to finally be. But it&#039;s not. This is just a plan for, &quot;At this moment this is what we kind of think the movie is going to be.&quot;<br /><br />For screenwriters overall, it&#039;s incredibly damaging, because I suddenly couldn&#039;t go to the trusted people who I want to have read my script. What&#039;s worse is that sort of forcing us to lock down the script, I can&#039;t let anyone else read that script if it&#039;s sort of stuck in development for awhile.<br /><br />You have to understand that when you&#039;re hiring screenwriters you are going to read scripts, their spec scripts. You&#039;re going to read stuff that&#039;s of movies that have been made, but you&#039;re also going to read the stuff that&#039;s in development, and that stuff does get handed around. And the rule is, like, just everybody be cool about it. Like you can pass the stuff around, just don&#039;t talk about it that much.<br /><br />This script I wrote for them I can&#039;t show anybody now because they sort of had it on this crazy lockdown. So those were my frustrations with Carson Reeves&#039;s Scriptshadow that is the back story that I needed to sort of setup for this newest blog post.<br /><br /><b>Craig Mazin:</b> And just to echo your thoughts here: Reviewing screenplays that are in development is a stupid, counterproductive thing to do. It is anti-writer. And it will make movies worse. Please don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />You don&#039;t review food as the chef is cooking it. We have drafts for a reason. You cannot write a final draft first. Anyone who actually writes for a living, who understands what writing, or painting, or writing a song, or sculpting something knows what I mean when I say it&#039;s not done. We&#039;re working — ING — on it. So if you put it on the internet like it&#039;s done and review it like it&#039;s done, you are hurting something that was not meant to be read or seen.<br /><br />Please be respectful enough to just wait until it&#039;s done. How hard is that? How hard is that? And I just find it so frustrating that people in their desperate need to be involved somehow, or to release a secret for whatever small burst of adrenaline that gives you, ruin something that somebody is working on. And they don&#039;t all turn out great.<br /><br />But, you know, the example I always give is The Sixth Sense, which is one of my favorite screenplays. He wasn&#039;t dead the whole time until like the sixth draft. You know what I mean? You have to wait. Just wait.<br /><br /><b>John August:</b> Yup. It&#039;s that need to be first, and that thrill at being first is why you — is that instinct to talk about it before it&#039;s ready to be talked about. But I think your cooking analogy is exactly right. It&#039;s not done. It&#039;s still in the oven. Stop. And that&#039;s maddening.<br /></div><br />Craig&#039;s comment about The Sixth Sense is particularly apropos. &nbsp;It&#039;s a sharp reminder that writers approach their craft differently. &nbsp;Some make detailed treatments -- their roadmap -- before banging out the first draft. &nbsp;They follow the map and mostly end up where they expect to. &nbsp;Others do a broad-strokes treatment or don&#039;t bother with one, opting instead to find the story through the rewriting process.<br /><br />I wondered if 10PTT hurts the latter. &nbsp;That would bug me. &nbsp;This site exists to help novice screenwriters. &nbsp;Necessarily, I need to be critical at times and be honest about my reaction to pages. &nbsp;That can be disheartening for a submitting author. &nbsp;I try to be encouraging about it, because that&#039;s how I want people treating me. &nbsp;Saying &quot;OMG, your writing stinks!&quot; has no value. &nbsp;I need to hear: &quot;Today your writing sucks. &nbsp;Here&#039;s why. &nbsp;Try these techniques. &nbsp;Tomorrow you&#039;ll suck less.&quot;<br /><br />Another ameliorating factor is how 10PTT is more about the words on the page than the story. &nbsp;I&#039;m more interested in helping you achieve an industry-standard level of writing than achieving a working story -- or rather, a working opening for your story, because we&#039;re only dealing with the first 10 pages. &nbsp;I believe once you can write the same way you drive a car -- competently and without thinking about it -- you&#039;re free to fully focus on story and polish it to perfection.<br /><br />Sure, you can write a fantastic story with poor word skills. &nbsp;And maybe a professional reader somewhere will overlook your writing shoddiness and boost your script up the ladder -- almost certainly with the assumption the script will get handed to an industry pro to lift the writing up to par. &nbsp;But I can tell you this: the proportion of sold scripts having mediocre story and great writing versus those having great story and lousy writing is vast. &nbsp;A hundred to one sounds about right.<br /><br />Master writing. &nbsp;Then master storytelling. &nbsp;Master then separately or together, but know you will not sell screenplays without mastering both.<br /><br />So having thought on it, I&#039;ve put my concern aside. &nbsp;On the whole, I don&#039;t think 10PTT harms screenwriters the way some people feel Scriptshadow harms screenwriters. &nbsp;I don&#039;t trash stories based on their first 10 pages. &nbsp;I don&#039;t rank scripts on a scale. &nbsp;I acknowledge these are draft pages.<br /><br />Me, you -- we&#039;re struggling to crack the code that unlocks the secret to engaging, effective, exciting writing on the page. &nbsp;When my writing sucks, I want you to tell me why and show me how to be better. &nbsp;I&#039;ll do the same for your where I can.<br /></div>
