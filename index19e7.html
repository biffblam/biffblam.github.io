					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div align="center">(https://10ptt.com/smf/10ptt_shake.gif)</div><br />&quot;Friend of the show&quot; Trevor Mayes wrote a cool little screenplay called 23 MINUTES. &nbsp;It happens to be the most viewed 10PTT (http://10ptt.com/smf/index.php?topic=293.0) in this here neck of the woods. &nbsp;Much of that is because Trevor can write. &nbsp;Really, really write. &nbsp;He loves words and images, sounds and feelings. &nbsp;When the author adores their tools, worships their craft, there&#039;s no mistaking it. &nbsp;That kind of thing blooms riotously on the page. &nbsp;You can&#039;t stop it, not with garden shears, not with chainsaws, not even with whatever vicious weed killer you care to slosh all over the place.<br /><br />When I read Trevor&#039;s FIRE FIGHT script -- it&#039;s another terrific read -- I knew I had to share it with you. &nbsp;Like Fox network&#039;s Masked Magician, I knew I had to slip behind the scenes and reveal how the magic happens.<br /><br />It&#039;s a simple process -- one you&#039;re familiar with if you&#039;ve read other 10PTTs. &nbsp;I take the first ten pages of the script and I highlight the hard-working bits in various colors to make them stand out on the page. &nbsp;Sort of like watching a naked magician on stage: all the wires and apparatus and gizmos are plain to see, no longer hidden up his or her sleeves. &nbsp;What you lose in wow factor you gain in appreciation for the skill applied.<br /><br />Hey, how come that&#039;s not a thing yet: the Naked Magician...? &nbsp;That should totally be a thing. &nbsp;Somebody other than Penn Jillette make that happen please.<br /><br />When the sentences turn transparent and you glimpse the circuit board beneath, it&#039;s a real &quot;Ah-ha!&quot; moment for growing writers. &nbsp;It helps define why some writing feels like the author spun you around and strapped rocket-powered wings to your back and other writing feels like the author kicked you into a swimming pool brimming with quicksand.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the markup legend:<br /><br />GREEN = Strong, active verbs<br />YELLOW = Figurative language (connotation)<br />BLUE = Strong, effective adjectives<br /><br />There may be overlap in how I&#039;ve applied those categories, and it&#039;s likely I missed some things. &nbsp;Just let your eye take in each whole page, survey the broad strokes of color, and you&#039;ll understand what&#039;s going on despite my errors and omissions.<br /><br />I&#039;m not adding comments to each page. &nbsp;This 10PTT is illustrative only -- a testament to what can be achieved when you follow the basic, proven writing rules.<br /><br />I do have one or two general observations before I hand over the pages.<br /><br />RACE/RACES - 6 times<br />RUSH/RUSHES - 5 times<br /><br />I didn&#039;t noticed the repetition while reading. &nbsp;So, I can&#039;t really say these words are overused based on their tally across ten pages. &nbsp;It struck me only when doing the markup later. &nbsp;But, I do see an opportunity to go back and swap in some other punchy verbs.<br /><br />As you scan through the green dynamic verbs, pay attention to their syllable count. &nbsp;It&#039;s mostly one or two. &nbsp;Short, powerful verbs pack a wallop.<br /><br />All righty! &nbsp;It&#039;s strap-on time! &nbsp; :o<br /><br />(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/tzzm8mv.gif)<br /><br />(It goes without saying: the Rocketeer&#039;s trousers must be made from fantastically heat-resistant kevlar...)</div>

And perfect Futurama imageru to boot!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="index2aa2.html?topic=371.msg1589#msg1589">Quote from: Pitchpatch on May 31, 2015, 04:34 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Trevor&#039;s FIRE FIGHT got him signed to Zero Gravity Management.<br /></div><br />Actually... The fact that FIRE FIGHT was in semis of the PAGE Awards and the top 25 of Tracking Board&#039;s Launchpad competition helped with street cred, but it was actually my writing on PROMISES (first) that got Zero Gravity&#039;s attention. Then my writing on BLOWN (second) that convinced them I could make them some money. Because I do love to write me some kick-ass action movies... and I hear they make a few of those every now and again.<br /><br />So those killer PROMISES notes you gave me -- payin&#039; all kinds of dividends.<br /><br />But yeah, strong concept + strong execution + multiple scripts (to prove you have the writing habit) + persistence (barring a lucky break, it&#039;s gonna take a while) + social competence (you don&#039;t want to embarrass them on meet and greets) + modest track record (contests wins, credits, talkin&#039; the talk, etc.) = sweet, succulent representation<br /><br />That&#039;s how it happened for me, at least. I&#039;m going to do my damnedest to capitalize on this opportunity. Wish me luck!</div>
