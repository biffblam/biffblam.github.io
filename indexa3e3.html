					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ANOTHER EARTH (Sundance)<br /><br />Simple idea leads to tricky questions... after you suspend your knowledge of cosmology and physics.<br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8hEwMMDtFY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BLZHxV3Hnw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Reminds me a little of Soderbergh&#039;s SOLARIS, a movie that for me did a great job blending the existential/personal with the cosmic.&nbsp; (My all time fav in that arena is Aronofsky&#039;s THE FOUNTAIN.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The Wikipedia article is a good read.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Launched from the EUROSEC Space Centre in Portugal, Kane and Ross are connected to &quot;Heart Lung Kidney&quot; machines that maintain them in stasis for a six-week round trip onboard their Phoenix spacecraft.</div> <br /><br />Bwahaha, what? Put in stasis for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">six-week</span> trip?&nbsp; I&#039;ll assume stasis was mandated for reasons other than a need to conserve toilet paper.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">For broadcasts in the United Kingdom, Doppelgänger has appeared under the Journey to the Far Side of the Sun title and has been formatted accordingly.[1] Transmissions have often included an inverted picture due to a mistake made in transferring an original master print to videotape.[1] Prior to a screening in the 1980s, a telecine operator viewed the print and, being unfamiliar with the plot, concluded that the parallel Earth sequences had been reversed in error.[5] An additional &quot;flop-over&quot; edit restored the image to normal, which became the standard for all broadcasts but compromised the plot: if Doppelgänger is screened with this modification, the viewer is led to conclude that the parallel Ross has landed on the &quot;normal&quot; Earth after the Dove disaster.[5]</div><br />&nbsp;;D<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">When times of financial crisis leaves a new couple with nothing left to lose, they set off on a crime spree, slipping into a romance as hot as the Arizona desert they blaze through. &nbsp;Dom and Stella are in love, on the run and in their 60s.<br /><br />-- WILDFLOWERS by Jim Stansberry and Annika Tuneld<br /></div><br />Great logline, and a satisfying one. &nbsp;A languid build up while it establishes a Bonnie-and-Clyde vibe, then at the end it smashes expectations with the reveal. &nbsp;The figurative language -- often hard to justify in a logline -- matches and facilitates the structure.<br /><br />All that in two sentences. A logline of 47 words isn&#039;t indulgent when the words combine like this.</div>

					Title: <b>Safety Not Guaranteed</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">WANTED: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You&#039;ll get paid when we return. Must bring own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I&#039;ve only done this once before.</div><br />This magazine advertisement spawned the movie SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/safety_not_guaranteed/).&nbsp; The ad is real (http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/silveira125.html).&nbsp; It appeared on page 92 of the Sept/Oct 1997 issue of Backwoods Home Magazine.<br /><br />It also happens to be a killer logline, thanks to that freaky last sentence hitting like a blast of frigid air.&nbsp; That, folks, is how you button a logline.<br /></div>
