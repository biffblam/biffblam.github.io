							<div class="post">Came across this on John August&#039;s blog, originally from a Wired article. <br /><br />221 snippets of quotes and ideas Lovecraft jotted down for future work.<br /><br /><img src="http://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/108198.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br /><b>COMMONPLACE BOOK</b><br /><br />This book consists of ideas, images, &amp; quotations hastily jotted down for possible future use in weird fiction. Very few are actually developed plots—for the most part they are merely suggestions or random impressions designed to set the memory or imagination working. Their sources are various—dreams, things read, casual incidents, idle conceptions, &amp; so on.<br />—H. P. Lovecraft<br /><br />Presented to R. H. Barlow, Esq., on May 7, 1934—in exchange for an admirably neat typed copy from his skilled hand.<br /><br /><br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demophon shivered when the sun shone upon him. (Lover of darkness = ignorance.)<br /><br />2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inhabitants of Zinge, over whom the star Canopus rises every night, are always gay and without sorrow. (x)<br /><br />3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shores of Attica respond in song to the waves of the Aegean. (x)<br /><br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horror Story<br />Man dreams of falling—found on floor mangled as tho’ from falling from a vast height. (x)<br /><br />5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Narrator walks along unfamiliar country road,—comes to strange region of the unreal.<br /><br />6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Ld Dunsany’s “Idle Days on the Yann”<br />The inhabitants of the antient Astahan, on the Yann, do all things according to antient ceremony. Nothing new is found.<br /><br />“Here we have fetter’d and manacled Time, who wou’d otherwise slay the Gods.” (x)<br /><br />7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horror Story<br />The sculptured hand—or other artificial hand—which strangles its creator. (x)<br /><br />8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hor. Sto.<br />Man makes appt. with old enemy. Dies—body keeps appt.<br /><br />9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Eben Spencer plot. (x)<br /><br />10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dream of flying over city. [Celephaïs]<br /><br />11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odd nocturnal ritual. Beasts dance and march to musick. (x)<br /><br />12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happenings in interval between preliminary sound and striking of clock—ending—<br /><br />“it was the tones of the clock striking three”. (x)<br /><br />13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; House and garden—old—associations. Scene takes on strange aspect.<br /><br />14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hideous sound in the dark.<br /><br />15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bridge and slimy black waters. [Fungi—The Canal]<br /><br />16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The walking dead—seemingly alive, but—. (x)<br /><br />17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doors found mysteriously open and shut etc.—excite terror.<br /><br />18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calamander-wood—a very valuable cabinet wood of Ceylon and S. India, resembling rosewood.<br /><br />19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revise 1907 tale—painting of ultimate horror.<br /><br />20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man journeys into the past—or imaginative realm—leaving bodily shell behind.<br /><br />21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very ancient colossus in a very ancient desert. Face gone—no man hath seen it.<br /><br />22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mermaid Legend—Encyc. Britt. XVI—40.<br /><br />23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who would not sleep—dares not sleep—takes drugs to keep himself awake. Finally falls asleep—and something happens. Motto from Baudelaire p. 214. [Hypnos]<br /><br />24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunsany—Go-By Street<br />Man stumbles on dream world—returns to earth—seeks to go back—succeeds, but finds dream world ancient and decayed as though by thousands of years.<br /><br /><br />1919<br /><br />25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man visits museum of antiquities—asks that it accept a bas-relief he has just made—old and learned curator laughs and says he cannot accept anything so modern. Man says that<br /><br />‘dreams are older than brooding Egypt or the contemplative Sphinx or garden-girdled Babylonia’<br /><br />and that he had fashioned the sculpture in his dreams. Curator bids him shew his product, and when he does so curator shews horror. Asks who the man may be. He tells modern name. “No—before that” says curator. Man does not remember except in dreams. Then curator offers high price, but man fears he means to destroy sculpture. Asks fabulous price—curator will consult directors.<br /><br />Add good development and describe nature of bas-relief. [Cthulhu]<br /><br />26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dream of ancient castle stairs—sleeping guards—narrow window—battle on plain between men of England and men of yellow tabards with red dragons. Leader of English challenges leader of foe to single combat. They fight. Foe unhelmeted, but there is no head revealed. Whole army of foe fades into mist, and watcher finds himself to be the English knight on the plain, mounted. Looks at castle, and sees a peculiar concentration of fantastic clouds over the highest battlements.<br /><br />27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life and Death<br />Death—its desolation and horror—bleak spaces—sea-bottom—dead cities. But Life—the greater horror! Vast unheard-of reptiles and leviathans—hideous beasts of prehistoric jungle—rank slimy vegetation—evil instincts of primal man—Life is more horrible than death.<br /><br />28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cats of Ulthar<br />The cat is the soul of antique Ægyptus and bearer of tales from forgotten cities of Meroë and Ophir. He is the kin of the jungle’s lords, and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa. The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten.<br /><br />29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dream of Seekonk—ebbing tide—bolt from sky—exodus from Providence—fall of Congregational dome.<br /><br />30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange visit to a place at night—moonlight—castle of great magnificence etc. Daylight shews either abandonment or unrecognisable ruins—perhaps of vast antiquity.<br /><br />31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prehistoric man preserved in Siberian ice. (See Winchell—Walks and Talks in the Geological field—p. 156 et seq.)<br /><br />32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As dinosaurs were once surpassed by mammals, so will man-mammal be surpassed by insect or bird—fall of man before the new race. (x)<br /><br />33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determinism and prophecy. (x)<br /><br />34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving away from earth more swiftly than light—past gradually unfolded—horrible revelation.<br /><br />35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special beings with special senses from remote universes. Advent of an external universe to view.<br /><br />36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disintegration of all matter to electrons and finally empty space assured, just as devolution of energy to radiant heat is known. Case of acceleration—man passes into space.<br /><br />37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peculiar odour of a book of childhood induces repetition of childhood fancy.<br /><br />38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drowning sensations—undersea—cities—ships—souls of the dead. Drowning is a horrible death.<br /><br />39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds—possibly musical—heard in the night from other worlds or realms of being.<br /><br />40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warning that certain ground is sacred or accursed; that a house or city must not be built upon it—or must be abandoned or destroyed if built, under penalty of catastrophe.<br /><br />41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Italians call Fear La figlia della Morte—the daughter of Death. (x)<br /><br />42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear of mirrors—memory of dream in which scene is altered and climax is hideous surprise at seeing oneself in the water or a mirror. (Identity?) [Outsider?]<br /><br />43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monsters born living—burrow underground and multiply, forming race of unsuspected daemons.<br /><br />44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Castle by pool or river—reflection fixed thro’ centuries—castle destroyed, reflection lives to avenge destroyers weirdly.<br /><br />45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Race of immortal Pharaohs dwelling beneath pyramids in vast subterranean halls down black staircases.<br /><br />46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawthorne—unwritten plot<br /><br />Visitor from tomb—stranger at some publick concourse followed at midnight to graveyard where he descends into the earth.<br /><br />47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Arabia Encyc. Britan. II—255<br /><br />Prehistoric fabulous tribes of Ad in the south, Thamood in the north, and Tasm and Jadis in the centre of the peninsula. “Very gorgeous are the descriptions given of Irem, the City of Pillars (as the Koran styles it) supposed to have been erected by Shedad, the latest despot of Ad, in the regions of Hadramaut, and which yet, after the annihilation of its tenants, remains entire, so Arabs say, invisible to ordinary eyes, but occasionally and at rare intervals, revealed to some heaven-favoured traveller.” // Rock excavations in N.W. Hejaz ascribed to Thamood tribe.<br /><br />48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cities wiped out by supernatural wrath.<br /><br />49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AZATHOTH—hideous name. (x)<br /><br />50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phleg′-e-thon—<br /><br />a river of liquid fire in Hades. (x)<br /><br />51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enchanted garden where moon casts shadow of object or ghost invisible to the human eye.<br /><br />52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calling on the dead—voice or familiar sound in adjacent room.<br /><br />53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hand of dead man writes.<br /><br />54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transposition of identity.<br /><br />55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man followed by invisible thing.<br /><br />56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Book or MS. too horrible to read—warned against reading it—someone reads and is found dead. Haverhill incident.<br /><br />57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sailing or rowing on lake in moonlight—sailing into invisibility.<br /><br />58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A queer village—in a valley, reached by a long road and visible from the crest of the hill from which that road descends—or close to a dense and antique forest.<br /><br />59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man in strange subterranean chamber—seeks to force door of bronze—overwhelmed by influx of waters.<br /><br />60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fisherman casts his net into the sea by moonlight—what he finds.<br /><br />61&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A terrible pilgrimage to seek the nighted throne of the far daemon-sultan Azathoth.<br /><br />62&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Live man buried in bridge masonry according to superstition—or black cat.<br /><br />63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinister names—Nasht—Kaman-Thah. (x)<br /><br />64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identity—reconstruction of personality—man makes duplicate of himself. (x)<br /><br />65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riley’s fear of undertakers—door locked on inside after death.<br /><br />66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catacombs discovered beneath a city (in America?).<br /><br />67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An impression—city in peril—dead city—equestrian statue—men in closed room—clattering of hooves heard from outside—marvel disclosed on looking out—doubtful ending.<br /><br />68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murder discovered—body located—by psychological detective who pretends he has made walls of room transparent.

(x)<br /><br />71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man has sold his soul to devil—returns to family from trip—life afterward—fear—culminating horror—novel length.<br /><br />72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hallowe’en incident—mirror in cellar—face seen therein—death (claw-mark?).<br /><br />73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rats multiply and exterminate first a single city and then all mankind. Increased size and intelligence.<br /><br />74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italian revenge—killing self in cell with enemy—under castle.

Such was the book discovered at Coptos, in the ancient sanctuary there, by a priest of the Goddess. ‘The whole earth was dark, but the moon shone all about the Book.’ A scribe of the period of the Ramessids mentions another in indecipherable ancient writing. ‘Thou tellest me thou understandest no word of it, good or bad.

Caus’d by rays from other dimensions acting on optick nerve? From other planets? Connected with a life or phase of being in which person could live if he only knew how to get there? Man afraid to shut eyes—he has been somewhere on a terrible pilgrimage and this fearsome seeing faculty remains.<br /><br />158&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man has terrible wizard friend who gains influence over him. Kills him in defence of his soul—walls body up in ancient cellar—BUT—the dead wizard (who has said strange things about soul lingering in body) changes bodies with him . . . leaving him a conscious corpse in cellar.

The undecayed, bloated thing found within.<br /><br />179&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appearance of an ancient god in a lonely and archaic place—prob. temple ruin. Atmosphere of beauty rather than horror.

Storm, sea, and frost have graven into the solid cliff of what has come to be known as Virgin’s Island an almost perfect outline of the Madonna with the Christ Child in her arms.<br /><br />The island has sheer and wave-bound sides, is a danger to ships, and is absolutely uninhabited. So far as is known, no human being has ever set foot on its shores.”<br /><br />210&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ancient house with blackened pictures on the walls—so obscured that their subjects cannot be deciphered. Cleaning—and revelation. Cf. Hawthorne—Edw. Rand.

Who was it who said there are only 7 stories? <br /></div><br />According to my writing wiki it was Christopher Booker in his book <i>The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories</i>.<br /><br />-----<br /><br /><b>Overcoming the Monster</b><br /><br />The first known story, The Epic Of Gilgamesh, is set in this form. So is the first James Bond movie, and of course a wealth of stories in between. Also the base for many video games, e.g. any Super mario jump&#039;n&#039;run.<br /><br />A hero learns of a great evil overshadowing the land (sometimes not his own land). He gets special equipment and/or weapons, heads out, and defeats the evil, freeing the land.<br /><br /><b>Rags To Riches</b><br /><br />The basic tale behind such gems as Aladdin and Cinderella (that one&#039;s technically riches to rags to royalty and riches), this shows the character arc, from an impoverished beginning to a complete, Happily Ever After end. At the end the character should have status, riches, and a mate, and often a kingdom as well.<br /><br />Key to this basic plot is the false ending, in which the hero appears to have gained his heart&#039;s desire - but it is too early, and he is too immature, so he loses it all, usually through some fault of his own (though not necessarily matched to the enormity of the loss). This loss is the most devastating blow to the hero, prior to the story&#039;s climax. In Aladdin it&#039;s the moment when the evil wizard uses the genie to steal the princess (note that the genie was lost because Aladdin failed to either keep it with him or inform his wife of the importance of the lamp).<br /><br />In another example (David Copperfield by Charles Dickens), the false ending is marriage to an immature wife, who soon dies - so the hero may actually lose the thing he wanted completely, only to get a better thing (a mature wife) by the end.<br /><br /><b>The Quest</b><br /><br />Show me a list of basic plots that doesn&#039;t have The Quest on it. Here it&#039;s the search for an object, a location or some information that requires our Hero to leave their (usually) everyday life to find. It&#039;s the basic plot most likely to include a party instead of a lone hero. Booker allows for four basic party types:<br /><br />- A close friend who is loyal but little else (Samwise Gamgee);<br />- A companion who is the hero&#039;s very opposite and usually displays opposite emotions, for good or ill (Sancho Panza);<br />- A large group of faceless minions who die right and left as the story goes on (a la The Odyssey - and often not a single one makes it to the end);<br />- or a balanced party distinguished by skills, generally Brains, Brawn, and &quot;Soul&quot; (which might be represented by courage, intuition, charisma, compassion, or spiritual power). Here, The Hero may be counted among them, or may be less specialized and merely rely on them.<br /><br /><b>Voyage and Return</b><br /><br />This is the backbone for Alice in Wonderland and The Labyrinth: The hero heads out into a realm in which the normal laws don&#039;t work and common sense isn&#039;t going to do him much good. It&#039;s the realm where intuition rules, rather than logic, and he&#039;s going to have to rely on the advice of allies or his own heart in order to pass the tests. But it stays pretty light, amusing, whimsical, until suddenly things take a dark turn. The hero finally overcomes the threat, and returns home mature but physically unchanged.<br /><br />Generally speaking (according to Booker), at the end of the story, a hero who has failed to join himself to a suitable cross-gendered mate is symbolically immature or unfinished. However, in Voyage and Return, the presence of a mate is actually a problem, since the hero can take nothing back with him but experience - hence he must leave his mate behind. Some stories attempt to avoid this problem by providing a parallel version of the hero&#039;s love when he returns home; see The One and The Forbidden Kingdom for two film examples.<br /><br /><b>Comedy</b><br /><br />Comedy, for Booker, is the grand mesh of relationships among a large cast, rooted in miscommunication. The fog of misunderstanding is maintained by some dark figure, often the hero&#039;s parent but sometimes the hero himself; the focus of the dark energy is in keeping the hero apart from his other half.<br /><br />Unlike the other stories, the villain here is almost never just defeated; he is often redeemed, brought to a point where he admits wrongdoing and joyfully joins the party of the other characters released from the fog. The misunderstandings get cleared up, the relationships get properly aligned (eliminating any Love Dodecahedron problems), and everything gets brought to light.<br /><br />Basically, if there&#039;s three or more relationships being prevented mostly by misunderstanding or lack of acceptance, you&#039;re looking at Booker&#039;s definition of a Comedy, even if the tone is rather dark. Shakespeare of course had several; George Bernard Shaw&#039;s Arms and the Man is another good example.<br /><br /><b>Tragedy</b><br /><br />Tragedy is the flip side of Overcoming the Monster: It&#039;s the tale of the villain spiraling down into evil and then being defeated by the hero. Here, release comes only with the death or destruction of the main character. The end, however tragic, is seen as just, even if we can sympathize with the villain and see some of his choices as right or forced.<br /><br />Booker&#039;s prime example for Tragedy is King Lear, in which the Tragic Hero realizes his fault at the end and repents - too late to be saved.<br /><br /><b>Rebirth</b><br /><br />Rebirth is the more optimistic form of Tragedy, in which the villain spirals down into evil and then at the last second raises his head and gets pulled out of the mire by some redeeming figure, either his other half or a young child. The redeemer awakens the hero&#039;s ability to love (or feel compassion) and helps him also to see things as they are, including, sometimes, a reordering of priorities. Silas Marner is Booker&#039;s main example, in which a little girl helps the miser to stop caring so much about his lost gold. Of course, when you begin combining elements from the seven basic plots, you end up with a more complex tale, like, for example, J.R.R. Tolkien&#039;s Lord of the Rings, which combines six (Tragedy for Saruman; Comedy the one absent).<br /><br /></div>
