					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just finished Aaron Sorkin&#039;s HBO Pilot. &nbsp;My god, if every script was this good. &nbsp;<br /><br />It didn&#039;t grab me in the beginning like his work usually does but I stuck with it. &nbsp;Half-way through I was enamored by it and couldn&#039;t wait to finish. &nbsp;With one page to go I was ready to break down and probably would have had he added another sappy line. &nbsp;<br /><br />I hope this gets made, I know I&#039;ll be there to watch it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This one&#039;s from a while back but I liked it so much I re-read it earlier this year, Justin Haythe&#039;s &quot;Snitch&quot; is pretty badass. Good news today was it&#039;s being made with the Rock.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Been reading a lot of pilots recently...<br /><br />17th Precinct by Ron Moore: Wonderfully detailed world, as you&#039;d expect from Mr. Moore.&nbsp; Concept is very &quot;out there.&quot;&nbsp; If the show makes it to air, it&#039;ll be interesting to see if it can find a mainstream audience.<br /><br />Charlie&#039;s Angels by Al Gough and Miles Millar: Slick, moves fast and they manage to pack lots of glitz onto every page.&nbsp; But the writing strikes me as hacky.&nbsp; Stock characters (especially the villains) and a LOT of cliched dialogue.<br /><br />Pan Am by Jack Orman: Fun, retro-y soap opera.&nbsp; Orman&#039;s a good writer.<br /><br />Playboy by Chad Hodge: Cut from the same cloth as Pan Am, but quite a bit more campy.<br /><br />REM by Kyle Killen: Solidly written.&nbsp; Interesting concept.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if there&#039;s enough of a hook to make me want to see the second episode, though.<br /><br />Wonder Woman by David E. Kelley: Jaw-droppingly bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;A flat-out embarrassment.</div>

EW has learned that NBC passed on the much buzzed-about Wonder Woman pilot from David E. Kelley and Warner Bros. TV.<br /><br />Kelley had penned a script that updated the comic book classic to have Diana Prince as CEO of a major conglomerate by day and a butt-kicking Amazon (with a fleet of cool planes) by night. Kelley’s take asked for lots of heart-thumping, contemporary music, and at one point the Boston Legal writer even requested a commercial-free premiere for the pilot if it aired.<br />Why did the ‘ol girl fail to pass muster?<br /><br />NBC isn’t saying for now but scuttlebutt reveals the pilot earned mixed reviews at test screenings. And then there was all the online blow back about the costume – which seemed to de-emphasize the patriotism and play up the comic’s Greek mythology. Ultimately, the wardrobe department went back to the drawing board but that didn’t seem to save the project.</div><br />(http://geeksofdoom.com/GoD/img/2011/03/2011-03-18-wonder_woman.jpg)<br /></div>
