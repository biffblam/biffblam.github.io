She is stunned to discover that this killer is wiping out the entire female bloodline of another family — her own — and she’s his next victim.</b><br /><br />-----<br /><br />Too eager to reach the reveal, this LL trips over its shoelaces. &nbsp;I think the problem lies with &quot;another family.&quot; &nbsp;It comes right before &quot;her own.&quot; &nbsp;The two ideas, clumped together like this, give us no time to understand each individually, that: (1) the killer previously wiped out the entire female bloodline of one or more families; (2) her family is his new victim. &nbsp;The first element supports our understanding of the second. &nbsp; I&#039;m going to put some thinking room between them:<br /><br /><b>Logline: FBI forensics expert Donna thinks a killer is erasing entire female bloodlines. &nbsp;When Donna&#039;s grandmother dies, then her mother, she&#039;s convinced she&#039;s next -- and then her three daughters.</b><br /><br />Gone: the passive parts, i.e. &quot;is called in to,&quot; &quot;is stunned to,&quot; &quot;is wiping out.&quot;<br /><br />Gone: gender/pronoun confusion. &nbsp;Usually we steer clear of using character names in LLs. &nbsp;But sometimes they&#039;re the solution when things get messy. &nbsp;The parade of female characters in my revision pretty much demanded it.<br /><br />Gone: &quot;vicious serial killer&quot; -- seems redundant to say serial killers are vicious. &nbsp;I dropped &quot;serial&quot; for several reasons -- save space, &nbsp;serial killer fatigue, whatever. &nbsp;Anything to make it less &quot;YIPPEE, ANOTHER SERIAL KILLER PREMISE!&quot;<br /><br />Gone: &quot;another family&quot; -- I figured &quot;female bloodline&quot; does enough to elicit a sense of family.<br /><br />Gone: &quot;she is stunned to discover&quot; -- a predictable reaction. &nbsp;Might as well save our breath and whitespace.<br /><br />Gone: &quot;she&#039;s his next victim&quot; -- I grabbed an opportunity to pack in more characters, more stakes. &nbsp;Grandmother, mother, daughter. &nbsp;Three generations, top to bottom. &nbsp;Yes, the killer could pluck females from the family tree at random, but isn&#039;t it more interesting for him to proceed in this orderly, compulsive manner?<br /><br />The other thing I did with the LL was introduce a smidge of uncertainty surrounding the protagonist. &nbsp;Is this happening the way she thinks it&#039;s happening? &nbsp;Could it be a simple, sad coincidence, her grandmother and mother dying like that while she&#039;s investigating the case? &nbsp;Do her superiors wonder if she&#039;s cracking under that double helping of grief? &nbsp;For them it would explain her sudden extreme need to protect her three daughters.<br /><br />That&#039;s just me riffing, of course. &nbsp;Go find and read the script to experience the story Tony wanted to tell.<br /><br />So far, lots of badass lady protags in this spec list.<br /></div>
