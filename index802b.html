							<div class="post"><div align="center"><img src="10ptt_shake.html" alt="" border="0" /></div><br />Jawbreaker kindly sent me the first ten from a western he abandoned long ago and shut away.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts for page 1. &nbsp;Chime in with your own observations and variations.<br /><br />As always with 10PTTs, remember, the supplied pages are an early or first draft. &nbsp;It&#039;s likely the author would catch some of these edits in their own polish. &nbsp;I don&#039;t consider my edits &#039;right&#039; and in a few cases I&#039;m not even sure my version improves what&#039;s on the page. &nbsp;Occasionally I&#039;ll revisit an old 10PTT and spot a suggested change where I definitely made things worse, not better. &nbsp;Sometimes you have to tinker with something to know you had it right the first time. &nbsp;Good writing is in the eye of the beholder. &nbsp;However, there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> well-established tenets of &#039;good writing&#039; that form the common foundation successful writers build upon. &nbsp;That&#039;s the bedrock I try to expose.<br /><br /><hr /><br />&quot;back to us&quot; -- not an issue, but an alternative to breaking the narrative fourth wall (&quot;we...&quot;, &quot;... us&quot;) would be &quot;... stands in the brush, facing away, holding a...&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Buffeted by wind.&quot; -- I&#039;m fairly sure it&#039;s the mask being buffeted, but it&#039;s not entirely clear. It could equally apply to the man. Or both. &nbsp;If it&#039;s the mask then you could clear it up with, &quot;... holding a crudely stitched MASK buffeted by wind.&quot; &nbsp;If it&#039;s the man then: &quot;A MAN stands in the brush, buffeted by wind, back to us, holding a...&quot;. &nbsp;(If you haven&#039;t nitpicked every sentence at least once, you&#039;re not me.)<br /><br />&quot;... holding a...&quot; -- if the wind threatens to rip it from his hand then how about powering up the verb to something like gripping, clutching, clenching...<br /><br />&quot;... a small, disreputable town.&quot; -- &#039;disreputable&#039; feels like the wrong word here. &nbsp;How do we know it&#039;s a disreputable town? &nbsp;All we can do is make snap judgements based on our brief initial glimpse from here. &nbsp;And from what it looks like we can quickly decide the town looks dodgy and disreputable.<br /><br />So we could label it &quot;a festering asshole of a town.&quot; &nbsp;Something that conveys &#039;disreputable&#039; without having to tell the reader it&#039;s disreputable. &nbsp;And we should name the town. &nbsp;Especially because we&#039;re sluglining it. &nbsp;For example: &quot;Before him... the small, disreputable town of BROKEN BOOT.&quot; &nbsp;Or if not naming it then I&#039;d just slug it as TOWN.<br /><br />1 - Moving the spatial reference (300 yard) and the moonlight description to the start of the sentence helps you form a complete mental picture as soon as you hit &#039;disreputable town&#039; instead of being introduced to the town then adding new facts (300 yards away; lit by moonlight). &nbsp;This is a personal quirk of mine. &nbsp;Try to help the reader form accurate images from the outset instead of making them assemble the image in pieces. &nbsp;If the audience will see the image on screen all at once then try to present that same immediate experience to the reader on the page. &nbsp;Stuff that &#039;sets the scene&#039; goes up front.<br /><br />Plus we reclaim a line of whitespace. &nbsp;You know by now how dearly I &nbsp;love to reclaim whitespace.<br /><br />2 - Eliminate redundancy: from down below = from below; creepily emerge = creep. &nbsp;&quot;from the vines, bushes and low trees&quot; is too much description. &nbsp;We already know they&#039;re standing in brush (bush, scrub, thicket) so let&#039;s just add the low trees and keep the action moving.<br /><br />3 - &quot;Across the road...&quot; And just like that we get some subtle, sly camera direction. &nbsp;Not CLOSE ON Sheriff Cobb, not PUSH IN on Sheriff Cobb. &nbsp;Just &quot;across the road&quot;. &nbsp;We&#039;ve established some distance. &nbsp;In your mind you might see it as a simple static wide shot establishing Cobb, or perhaps a slow dolly from the street closing in on him. &nbsp;Whatever, the key element surely is Old Glory framing the shot. &nbsp;You should always be subtly manipulating your reader&#039;s focus in this non-technical way. &nbsp;The gentle hand on the shoulder nudging the reader this way and that. &nbsp;Done right they&#039;ll never notice your gentle touch. &nbsp;Because if they do begin to notice it they&#039;ll begin to resist it. &nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;... watching the scene.&quot; -- Don&#039;t miss an opportunity to turn a bland verb into a more forceful one, and reveal some extra characterization along the way. &nbsp;How is Cobb observing proceedings? &nbsp;Disinterested? &nbsp;Attentive? &nbsp;Worried? &nbsp;Like a contented king? &nbsp;Like someone who knows he has few friends?<br /></div>

For example, if we suggest a slow and gentle &#039;move&#039; then we characterize COBB as a gentle man (and a gentleman), cautious and somewhat slow to excite in the face of potential conflict. &nbsp;In that case we could still amp up the verb to something like &quot;Easing the Young Lady aside&quot; or &quot;Guiding...&quot; or &quot;Maneuvering...&quot; -- all of which strengthen our perception of Cobb as a man who treats women well. &nbsp;On the other hand, if Cobb has a less delicate opinion of the ladyfolk then he should be &quot;Batting the Young Lady aside&quot; or &quot;Shoving...&quot; or &quot;Elbowing...&quot;.<br /><br />2 - Slight confusion in this section due to word choice. &nbsp;&#039;Rider&#039; implies the person is in the saddle. &nbsp;But maybe that isn&#039;t what was intended. &nbsp;Because of &#039;face down, lies moaning&#039; prior to &#039;collapses to the ground,&#039; I&#039;m thinking the rider isn&#039;t in the saddle at all but slung across the horse&#039;s back. &nbsp;And from there he collapses to the ground. &nbsp;BUT, that wouldn&#039;t let us see the smoke that &#039;seeps from his chest.&#039; &nbsp; So let&#039;s go back to the dude being flopped over in the saddle. &nbsp;That posture might give us a glimpse of his smoking chest -- although &#039;face down&#039; and &#039;lies moaning&#039; still fight to contradict that image. &nbsp;Face down might simply mean head hanging forward... but traditionally &#039;face down&#039; suggests &#039;face down on the floor&#039;, i.e. prone.<br /><br />Point is, this small sequence brought me to a standstill. &nbsp;I couldn&#039;t continue until I got it straight in my mind&#039;s eye. &nbsp;Undoubtedly Jawbreaker understood what he was writing, but it didn&#039;t land on the page cleanly. &nbsp;Not for me, anyway. &nbsp;Ambiguity like this is death to readability. &nbsp;You never want your reader to reread what they just read because they didn&#039;t understand it the first time. &nbsp;So here I&#039;d suggest revising to make it clear if the guy&#039;s slumped in the saddle, lying forward almost prone, or draped across the horse like a sack. &nbsp;Think about it like you&#039;re the director scene-blocking for the actors and you can&#039;t go wrong. &nbsp;Oh. And if &#039;smoke imperceptibly seeps from his chest&#039; then technically we see NO smoke coming from his chest. It&#039;s there, but it&#039;s imperceptible. :-) Could rewrite to e.g. &quot;Faint threads of smoke seep from his chest.&quot;<br /><br />3 - &quot;Cobb&#039;s attention drawn to&quot; works in a novel, but it can be left inferred on this script page. &nbsp;We&#039;re getting deep into an awesome moment and we don&#039;t want to be yanked out by switching perspectives. &nbsp;Right now WE ARE COBB. &nbsp;We&#039;re seeing through his eyes via the magic of cinematic character identification. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know about you, but for me this moment is playing out in tight slowmo, instantly drawing me further into the dramatic tension. &nbsp;&quot;Doesn&#039;t seem any too frightened...&quot; See? &nbsp;None too frightened. We&#039;re experiencing this THROUGH COBB, w00t! &nbsp;These are the screenwriting moments of deep immersion we live for! &nbsp;So let&#039;s stay focused on the rider, even though on screen we&#039;ll be getting a shot of Cobb reacting as he speaks his line.<br /><br />&quot;As the Rider&#039;s eyes start to close...&quot; &nbsp;Ayup, we&#039;re in nutsack-tightening slowmo, huzzah! &nbsp;Sound drops out, allowing us to FEEL the almighty VVOOMPH! of the impact... &nbsp;CRASH! Young Lady united with that pretty dress she was eyeing yesterday in the store window. &nbsp;And Cobb&#039;s face shakes hands with Mr Wagon. &nbsp;Loving the clipped, violent description for this brief, exciting sequence.<br /><br />So on page 2 we get a big bang inciting incident that changes everything (we assume). &nbsp;Did the Young Lady survive? &nbsp;We assume Cobb did, because we assume he&#039;s the good guy. &nbsp;We don&#039;t know for sure. &nbsp;Could be the bad guy, but unlikely because the dude with the mask from page 1 sure felt like a bad guy. &nbsp;And we&#039;re trained to expect to meet the good guy in the first few pages. &nbsp;(Important to introduce your hero early to get the audience attached and invested early.) Very convenient that this short action sequence falls on a page break. &nbsp;I&#039;m dying to flip over and see what comes next.<br /><br />Oh, and I ringed in green some hard-working verbs. &nbsp;I didn&#039;t ring &#039;blows&#039; because it&#039;s not all that grunty. &nbsp;I want the explosion to PUNCH the Young Lady through that window. &nbsp;Maybe CLOBBER or WALLOP her through it, or CLUB her through, or CANONBALL her through. &nbsp;Bwahaha, what? &nbsp;Canonball her? &nbsp;Fire, shoot, heave, hurl -- to my mind all these are by degrees more active than the stock standard &#039;blow&#039;. &nbsp;It&#039;s all subjective though. &nbsp;This action sequence works, but I can&#039;t help the urge to nudge the dial up to eleven.<br /></div>

							<div class="post">&quot;Climbs to her feet&quot; is fine but here I&#039;d like to see more effort suggested -- what just happened was a big deal, and had to take a toll on her fragile body. &nbsp;Something like &quot;Struggles to her feet. Dazed and numb. Disbelieving the rubble.&quot; &nbsp;I mean, sure, with what&#039;s there now we can color between the lines easily enough, but why not shoot for both conotation and denotation in the same sentence -- fact and feeling. &nbsp;Something like &#039;disbelieving the rubble&#039; tells you the fact she&#039;s staring at that rubble plus the feeling etched on her face.<br /><br />1 - I dispute the fresh location slug here. &nbsp;We started in EXT. DISREPUTABLE TOWN on page 1 and we never left that broad arena. &nbsp;What we&#039;re doing is seemlessly flitting between geographically adjacent sub-locations: THE STREET; INSIDE THE STORE; BACK OUTSIDE. &nbsp;Actually, you could rewrite the page 1 slug to EXT. &nbsp;TOWN STREET instead of the unnecessarily expansive TOWN. &nbsp;In any case, we don&#039;t re-slug here. &nbsp;We sub-slug (I don&#039;t know what the proper term is for this -- if indeed there is one). &nbsp;And because we&#039;ve got STREET slugged, we don&#039;t need to repeat that we&#039;re out on the road now.<br /><br />&quot;RED, WHITE and BLUE run right past, BLACK comes forth...&quot; -- another jarring moment making me halt and review what I just read. &nbsp;My first thought was &quot;Red, white, blue... old glory mentioned page 1... so... flag...? &nbsp;Huh?&quot; &nbsp;Oh, running past... so... people... oh, okay, these are the names of the dudes we saw earlier creeping from the bushes. &nbsp;And I&#039;m guessing BLACK is the leader? &nbsp;Confusion reigns because these names are thrown in with no preparation. &nbsp;Did the writer forget to state that each ominous figure creeping from the bushes wore a COLORED mask? i.e.<br /><br />-----<br />A MAN stands in the brush, back to us, holding a crudely stitched BLACK mask. Buffeted by wind.<br /><br />Before him, nestled in the rolling plains: a small, disreputable town. Bathed in moonlight. &nbsp;About 300 yards away.<br /><br />PARTY noise from down below, wafting... as his three friends -- wearing their plain colored masks of RED, WHITE, the last in BLUE -- creepily emerge from the vines, bushes and low trees behind him -- <br />-----<br /><br />Then we know exactly who RED, WHITE and BLUE are on the page here.<br /><br />&quot;... throws her to the ground by her hair.&quot; &nbsp;Again, this is perfectly okay, but I want to point out, as this unfolds on the screen what we see is BLACK grabbing a fistful of her long hair then using it to drag her to the ground. &nbsp;I&#039;d reverse that sentence to match the flow of action: &quot;BLACK comes forth, catches her long hair, throws her to the ground.&quot;<br /><br />2. &quot;INT. LOBBY&quot; -- we can lose the INT/EXTs when it&#039;s obvious we&#039;re interior or exterior. &nbsp;STREET, for example, won&#039;t ever be INT. &nbsp;Same with LOBBY, which almost never will be EXT. &nbsp;BANK could be EXT, but the first words tell us we&#039;re INT, so no danger of confusion by losing the INT here -- and you SHOULD omit production draft scaffolding in your spec. &nbsp;Hopefully the time will come when you sell the story -- yes, we&#039;re trying to sell stories, NOT scripts -- and you or somebody else will reformat the script into a technical blueprint suitable for a 200-strong team of craftsmen to go ahead and turn your words into sound and images.<br /><br />&quot;... weapons raised.&quot; -- While that&#039;s perfectly accurate, I saw it as a tiny opportunity to add color and &#039;feeling&#039;. &nbsp;&quot;... weapons bristling&quot; or maybe &quot;... weapons snarling...&quot; &nbsp;I like the personification of &#039;snarling&#039;. &nbsp;Suggests guns with an evil mind all of their own.<br /><br />3 - I felt it was important to tell us up front that the Bank Manager is female.&nbsp; Introduced to a genderless MANAGER, most folks would immediately picture a man in the role.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; Blame Wild West stereotyping.&nbsp; I threw in &#039;elderly&#039; because a young frontier lady bank manager seemed to me even more unlikely.&nbsp; But I admit I haven&#039;t done the research.&nbsp; Anyway, I initially pictured a man then one line of dialogue later I had to haul down that image and replace it with a picture of a woman.&nbsp; Try to help the reader build an accurate, clear picture right out of the gate.<br /><br />AND HOLY SHIT DO THINGS GET EXCITING FROM &#039;INT. LOBBY&#039; FORWARD. &nbsp;A burst of green-ringed action words signifies Jawbreaker is really focusing our senses here as the thugs expertly perform their thuggery.<br /><br />USHER, PROPEL, POUR, HANGS, RACES, VAULTS, JERKS, SPINS, SHOVES...<br /><br />HELL YES! &nbsp;This action sequence skips along beautifully, driven by short, punchy, declarative sentences. &nbsp;No time for embellishment. &nbsp;Things are happening fast, and all you need is for the reader to keep up. &nbsp;Reading this, you probably didn&#039;t feel your heart accelerate a little, but it probably did. &nbsp;Cranking the dramatic tension. &nbsp;Another page finishes on a page-turner. &nbsp;Great stuff.<br /><br />Oh, and backtracking to &quot;... and a DUMBASS appears to be making a move...&quot; -- more delicious narrative viewpoint. &nbsp;I love narrative viewpoint because it&#039;s so damn efficient (and delightful). &nbsp;By conveying this step of action through Black&#039;s viewpoint we get TWO strong images: the clumsy, well-meaning-but-DUMBASS man trying to &#039;do the right thing&#039; and failing miserably, followed by BLACK&#039;s jaded but practiced reaction. &nbsp;&quot;Black quickly subdues him.&quot; -- don&#039;t need any more detail than that because we know how thugs deal with DUMBASSES trying to be heros. &nbsp;We&#039;ve seen it a million times. &nbsp;So that&#039;s the beauty of slipping into character narrative viewpoint now and then. &nbsp;The most powerful writing is when you connect the most to a character... and you can&#039;t connect any better than being inside the character&#039;s head!<br /></div>

							<div class="post">&quot;He GRABS Cobb, holding him close&quot; -- Can shorten this to &quot;He JERKS/TUGS/HAULS Cobb close.&quot; Six words to four. &nbsp;Not worth it, you say. &nbsp;I say, do this four or five times per page and watch your 110-page script magically shrink to 105 or 100. &nbsp;Consistent small edits add up. &nbsp;Especially when they eliminate orhpans and give you back whitespace (not the case here, but I&#039;m about to explain why it&#039;s still a win.) &nbsp;They don&#039;t only serve to reduce your page count. &nbsp;They make your story read faster. &nbsp;What&#039;s a &#039;fast&#039; read? &nbsp;That&#039;s a script you read in one sitting because it never occurs to your to stop reading. &nbsp;You never get bogged down and you never feel like you&#039;re fighting the author to understand what&#039;s going on. &nbsp;Conveying your idea in less words takes less effort to comprehend -- and a fraction of time less to feed into your reader&#039;s eyeballs.<br /><br />&quot;(more demanding)&quot; -- parenthicals are the devil&#039;s toothpicks (and the devil is Joe Eszterhas, never forget). &nbsp;They rob you of a linespace. &nbsp;Demand they justify themselves. &nbsp;Take it out, read it -- is there confusion now about who&#039;s speaking, who it&#039;s directed at, or how it&#039;s being said? &nbsp;No? &nbsp;Congratulations on reclaiming a linespace. &nbsp;Here, we infer the &#039;demanding&#039; tone from two things: the preceding action where Blue yanks Cobb close, and the ellipsis between words. &nbsp;That&#039;s all we need. &nbsp;We&#039;ve got 2 + 2 and we can figure the answer without further assistance.<br /><br />Alright, so now we&#039;re at that part I blocked out in blue.<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked it over a couple times and I think I know what&#039;s bothering me. &nbsp;It&#039;s too many short single lines clustered in one block -- made worse if I scrub the INT. as shown.<br /><br />-----<br />BANK<br /><br />PEOPLE<br /><br />are FROZEN...<br /><br />BLACK<br /><br />tosses<br /><br />THE LAST CANVAS BAG<br /><br />through the air...<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I&#039;m not keen on immediatly following a slugline with a shot/subslug. &nbsp;It&#039;s too abrupt, I&#039;d argue. &nbsp;On the other hand, I do sort of like the visual shorthand Jawbreaker&#039;s doing here: BLACK, then carry shot to CANVAS BAG, then follow bag through air into WHITE&#039;S hands. &nbsp;I&#039;ll start by clearly delineating the slugline so there&#039;s no chance it&#039;ll bleed visually into the scene content...<br /><br />-----<br />BANK<br /><br />The townsfolk frozen in place. &nbsp;Unbreathing. &nbsp;Praying for this to end.<br /><br />BLACK<br /><br />tosses the last canvas bag through the air and<br /><br />WHITE<br /><br />catches it, GRUNTING with effort.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />One less line in my rewrite (and forgive my elaboration on the scene). &nbsp;So if nothing else we&#039;ve saved whitespace. &nbsp;The original hints at three focus points/shots: on THE PATRONS, on BLACK, on THE BAG. &nbsp;But a director might film it as a single moving shot, a single locked-off shot (letting the foreground, midground, background do the work), or a couple of shots/angles. &nbsp;A director could film this tiny sequence a dozen ways, even though the flow of action is giving us just a couple points of focus. &nbsp;If we remove all focus cues we&#039;d get something like...<br /><br />-----<br />BANK<br /><br />The townsfolk frozen in place. &nbsp;Unbreathing. &nbsp;Praying for this to end.<br /><br />BLACK tosses the last canvas bag to WHITE, who GRUNTS with effort.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />It comes down to the question, is it worth six lines on the page -- effectively 11 counting the doublespacing! -- to convey maybe three seconds of screen time? I&#039;m a fan of subslugs, but sometimes it&#039;s not a good fit, like here in this little scene.<br /><br />Back to the edits.<br /><br />&quot;Walks to the edge of the roof&quot; -- we can lose &#039;of the roof&#039; because &#039;roof&#039; is right there in the subslug above. &nbsp;It&#039;s fresh in our mind.<br /><br />&quot;walk&quot; -&gt; &quot;stride&quot; - like &#039;look&#039;, &#039;walk&#039; is bland and a bit of an underachiever. &nbsp;Considering the &#039;calm and alert&#039; descriptor that follows, &#039;stride&#039; (to walk with purpose) feels like the right word here.<br /><br />&quot;roughly grabs&quot; -&gt; &quot;seizes&quot; ... because the one means precisely the other and usually you go with the shorter expression -- for the reasons I outlined near the top of this post.<br /><br />&quot;Fuck -- he hit him hard&quot; -- narrator interjection/observation. &nbsp;I like &#039;em. &nbsp;Can be risky. &nbsp;It can yank your reader out of the story because you&#039;re reminding them there&#039;s somebody (the author) standing between the reader and the story. &nbsp;Plus, it&#039;s important to know who&#039;s viewpoint is making the comment. &nbsp;Whose interior monologue is it? &nbsp;Here we assume it&#039;s the author, not another character in the scene. &nbsp;We&#039;re at a page end, so maybe the following page makes it clear if it&#039;s the author or Blue making the comment. &nbsp;Here&#039;s an example of author versus character interior monologue:<br /><br /><br />AUTHOR:<br />-----<br />WHAM! &nbsp;Cobbs&#039;s face rocks to the side.<br /><br />Ouch. A cold steak couldn&#039;t stop that swelling. Try a side of beef.<br />-----<br /><br />SHANE BLACK:<br />-----<br />WHAM! &nbsp;Cobbs&#039;s face rocks to the side.<br /><br />Speaking of bags of loot, last week I threw away my computer chair. &nbsp;Now I sit atop the pile of cash I built from my Lethal Weapon residuals. &nbsp;Admittedly I&#039;m having a hard time reaching my keyboard from way up here. &nbsp;So anyway... Oh, yeah, and I threw away my TV chair too. &nbsp;Replaced that with a pyramid of cocaine. &nbsp;Let me tell you, gentle reader: once you park your caboose on a giant mound of loot and toot you&#039;ve reached the absolute zenith of office ergonomics.<br /><br />So back to Cobb...<br /><br />Um... blah-de-blah-blah... fight scenes, a three-legged dog for comic relief, a stagecoach chase and... um, a helicopter crammed with hostage Korean factory children who were forced to swallow heroin-filled condoms. &nbsp;You do the math. &nbsp;Here&#039;s a pencil to fill in the 100 blank pages following this one. &nbsp;TOODLES! &nbsp; <br />-----<br /><br />CHARACTER:<br />-----<br />WHAM! &nbsp;Cobbs&#039;s face rocks to the side.<br /><br />Blue rubs his tingling fist and sniggers. &nbsp;Fuck -- he hit him hard.<br />-----<br /><br /></div>

							<div class="post">I&#039;m not supposed to play with dialogue. &nbsp;One of my 10PTT guidelines is to focus solely on description/action -- where the narrative heavy lifting takes place. &nbsp;Couldn&#039;t help myself here. &nbsp;The unmasking didn&#039;t play right in my mind&#039;s eye. &nbsp;The &#039;... It&#039;s --&#039; has to come just before RED/TOM peels off that mask, with him completing the thought as we and 6F6 take in his full features...<br /><br />-----<br />Gets close. Looks into his eyes. Very intense.<br /><br />RED<br />No-- No he won&#039;t. It&#039;s...<br /><br />and PULLS off his MASK.<br />Six Foot Six&#039;s eyes go wide.<br /><br />RED/TOM<br />(wry smile)<br />... all part of the plan.<br /><br />SIX FOOT SIX<br />You...!<br /><br />Meet TOM...<br />-----<br /><br />And I reckon we can safely lose Six Foot&#039;s last line of dialogue and instead button the scene on:<br /><br />-----<br />Tom rises, strolls toward the stairwell.<br /><br />SIX FOOT SIX<br /><br />Frozen. &nbsp;Not knowing quite WHAT to think.<br />-----<br /><br />It&#039;s all there in the &quot;YOU!&quot; and off his look.<br /><br />1. &quot;INT. BRICKWORK - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT&quot; -- Slight problem. &nbsp;We just cut from Tom and Red leaving the bank roof to Tom and Red in a corridor. &nbsp;Somewhere. &nbsp;Those paying attention can join the dots: Six Foot told Tom and Red &#039;she&#039; is holed up &#039;in Brickwork.&#039; &nbsp;So they must now be in a building within the town of Brickwork. &nbsp;Assuming Brickwork is a town. &nbsp;It&#039;s a solid guess, but we can&#039;t say for sure. &nbsp;Maybe &#039;Brickwork&#039; is the name of a prison -- probably not judging by the decor in this corridor. &nbsp;Everything from opening scene on has been set at night, don&#039;t forget. &nbsp;And that&#039;s not going to help our sense of surroundings.<br /><br />If the fellas hoofed it over to this new town of Brickwork then an establishing exterior shot would remove any guesswork. &nbsp;Jawbreaker follows the laudable rule of getting out of and into scenes as quick as possible -- string the beads (scenes) then snip away the string *between* the beads, i.e the boring connective fabric -- but for me this is cutting it a tad too fine at the expense of clarity.<br /><br />I like this flurry of action at the door. &nbsp;Because we&#039;re sufficiently spatially and contextually oriented (call me Poindexter) when the time comes for Tom to pound that door we can trim things and help the flow really zip along...<br /><br />-----<br />TOM<br /><br />kicks the door in. &nbsp;It EXPLODES off its top hinges and hangs disabled. &nbsp;Seamlessly continues his momentum and rushes through.<br />-----<br /><br />to something like...<br /><br />-----<br />TOM<br /><br />KICKS -- the door EXPLODES off its top hinges and hangs disabled. &nbsp;Momentum rushing him through into --<br />-----<br /><br />&quot; - CONTINUOUS&quot; &nbsp;My personal preference is to use CONTINUOUS to avoid ambiguity or confusion when slugging. &nbsp;If there&#039;s no possible confusion -- as here -- don&#039;t bother. &nbsp;Slug accoutrement does slow down the read, moreso during an action sequence. &nbsp;Leave unnecessary slug busiwork for the production draft.<br /></div>

							<div class="post">1. I found this confusing for a moment. &nbsp;The guard races across the room &#039;for the rear, heading for Tom.&#039; &nbsp;Which means the door Tom kicked down and stormed through is the room&#039;s back entrance (?). &nbsp;There&#039;s no indication prior to now that the door Tom and Blue arrived at was a back entrance. &nbsp;The reader would be forgiven for assuming it&#039;s the front entrance. &nbsp;I did, without giving it any thought. &nbsp;So when the reader hits &#039;racing across the room for the rear&#039; it&#039;s jarring. &nbsp;The reader must pause and rearrange the scene in his or her head. &nbsp;If it&#039;s important that we know this is a rear door then give that information up front. &nbsp;On the other hand, if Tom and Blue ARE at the room&#039;s front door then why is the guard described as racing toward the rear of the room past Isabel yet somehow toward Tom? &nbsp;Oh wait... is the GUARD the SHOOTER behind the door, and so Tom and Blue already surged past him not seeing him? &nbsp;I&#039;m gonna need Jawbreaker to adjucate this one.<br /><br />2. We&#039;re on BLUE, who whirls around... and now we&#039;re (presumably) on Isabel as Tom hollers her name O.S. -- &quot;Isabel!&quot; -- and we cut to Tom with his gun drawn already... So let&#039;s &#039;cut to the chase&#039; and skip the aiming. &nbsp;She smiles, apparently aware he won&#039;t shoot her, that they need her alive... Tom knows it, fisting the windowsill in frustration...<br /><br />We can easily lose the parenthetical &quot;(then)&quot; because all it does is steal a linespace. &nbsp;Actors will figure out the delivery. &nbsp;If your actor is Christopher Walken then he&#039;ll take a pen to your script page and randomly mark dialogue here, here, there... one more there -- indicating where he&#039;ll... pause for... dramatic effect. &nbsp;If your actor is Bill Murray then he&#039;ll glance at your script page, mumble &quot;Yeah yeah,&quot; push it back to you or ball it up and toss it... then he&#039;ll give you an adlibbed performance far better than you could&#039;ve written.<br /><br />&quot;He runs to the window&quot; -- perfect example of leaving out the stage business, letting the context fill in the gap. &nbsp;Survey ten film fans by showing them this scene but freeze-framing on Tom&#039;s face when he says &quot;Dammit!&quot; and asking them what happens next... I wager eight or nine fans will correctly guess he runs to the window.<br /><br />&quot;POUNDS the windowsill in frustration&quot; -- is there any other reason he might pound the window, given the context? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Thus we can omit &#039;in frustration&#039; because it adds nothing to the narrative.<br /><br />&quot;... claustrophobic recess&quot; -- again, this felt unnecessary. &nbsp;How do we know the recess is tiny if it&#039;s veiled in shadow? &nbsp;And it can&#039;t be too claustrophobic if it&#039;s large enough to shelter a horse. &nbsp;Although from the horse&#039;s viewpoint, yeah, that tight squeeze will be claustrophobic, no question.<br /><br />&quot;MAIN DRAG ... Wait for it...&quot; -- Bwahaha, another page that falls perfectly on a page-turning moment. &nbsp;What is that now? &nbsp;Three absolute page-turners in eight pages? &nbsp;Fortuitous or designed, this is working well for Jawbreaker!<br /></div>

							<div class="post">I realise the author is shifting stylistic gears here with the &#039;AND TOM... AND ISABEL&#039; but I&#039;m not convinced it works any better than the regular (and briefer) character subslugging. &nbsp;If it works for you then mentally reinstate those ANDs.<br /><br />I was once more compelled to ring the strong verbs and action words on this page. &nbsp;Quite a breathless read.<br /><br />&quot;Tom SMASHES into her.&quot; &nbsp;It&#039;s implied, I guess, that Tom leaps from the saddle here, not that he&#039;s crashing into her bodily with the horse. <br /><br />If Tom whines another petulant &quot;DAMMIT!&quot; I may have to slap him upside the head. :-)<br /><br />&quot;TOM: I&#039;m alive.&quot; -- another great page end! &nbsp;Who could resist flipping the page to see what comes next? &nbsp;Well... apologies but I&#039;m not giving you any more. &nbsp;This is a first time ever for a 10PTT, but I&#039;m ending prematurely here on Page 9. &nbsp;It&#039;s the perfect spot to wrap it up. &nbsp;&quot;I&#039;m alive.&quot; &nbsp;That&#039;s a scene button if I ever saw one. &nbsp;And I&#039;ll risk Jawbreaker&#039;s fury to leave you hanging and wanting more.<br /><br />Oh, the scene does continue, though. &nbsp;Here&#039;s some of what you&#039;re missing:<br /><br />-----<br />ISABEL<br />I&#039;m saying this is like tryin&#039; to<br />balance a six-shooter on the tip of<br />your dick.<br />-----<br /><br />But I prefer to keep some mystery. &nbsp;How do Tom and Isabel know each other? &nbsp;Is Tom a good guy or bad guy? &nbsp;What&#039;s the deal with the guy who suicide-vests at the start -- why does he willingly blow himself up? &nbsp;(I don&#039;t expect an answer to that one, but I&#039;m still intrigued.)<br /><br />So there we are: the first nine for DOWN IN A HOLE by Jawbreaker. &nbsp;You can&#039;t say it&#039;s not brimming with action and conflict. &nbsp;I liked it. &nbsp;Where we left off at page 9 it&#039;s still not clear whose side everyone is on, but we can make some educated guesses. &nbsp;You would not put this script down due to boredom. &nbsp;It&#039;s an exciting opening.<br /><br />Thanks again to Jawbreaker for taking the plunge and gritting his teeth throughout my rough &quot;spread em&#039;&quot; surgical-gloved examination. &nbsp;I enjoyed this 10PTT a lot.<br /></div>

What about &quot;He lets her anticipation peak then moves to finish...&quot;.</b></span><br /><br />You&#039;re over-explaining it - he <i>already</i> has her attention. &nbsp;So yeah, that&#039;d be redundant. &nbsp;Also, my sentence is more active and hits better. &nbsp;Just sayin&#039;. &nbsp;<img src="Smileys/express2/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0" /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>&quot;... he hears a ghastly noise...&quot; -- in a moment we learn the &#039;ghastly noise&#039; is a man moaning.</b></span><br /><br />Why hold back?<br /><br />To keep people reading.<br /><br />But yeah, I actually changed this is a later draft - now it&#039;s a crowd reaction that draws his attention.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>&quot;Climbs to her feet&quot; is fine but here I&#039;d like to see more effort suggested -- what just happened was a big deal, and had to take a toll on her fragile body. Something like &quot;Struggles to her feet. Dazed and numb. Disbelieving the rubble.&quot;</b> <i>I mean, sure, with what&#039;s there now we can color between the lines easily enough</i>[...]</span><br /><br />That&#039;s the point. &nbsp;Let the reader fill in the blanks.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>&quot;... weapons raised.&quot; -- While that&#039;s perfectly accurate, I saw it as a tiny opportunity to add color and &#039;feeling&#039;. &quot;... weapons bristling&quot; or maybe &quot;... weapons snarling...&quot; I like the personification of &#039;snarling&#039;. Suggests guns with an evil mind all of their own. </b></span><br /><br />Last I checked, guns were scary - I don&#039;t think you need to jazz them up. &nbsp;In fact, that description would kick me out of a story.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>[...]if she&#039;s scared to death, having seen this guy brutalize others moments ago. If that&#039;s the case, give us that motivation on the page.</b></span><br /><br />As I mentioned before, it&#039;s implied.<br /><br />I already provide a framework of visuals that tell the story so the reader (and audience) can put two &amp; two together and visualize what&#039;s happening on the screen. &nbsp;And yeah, this --<br /><br /><i>Manager unlocks the STEEL CAGE inside the big vault -- Black takes her inside, nods her over to the shelves holding the money boxes -- She hesitates -- He flashes the butt of his pistol -- no contest -- their hands blur as STACKS OF MONEY are shoved into canvas sacks. </i><br /><br />-- would&#039;ve killed momentum.<br /><br />Always, always err on the side of brevity. &nbsp;Trust the reader. &nbsp;But you may be right in this case. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know. &nbsp;Need more opinions.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>&quot;He GRABS Cobb, holding him close&quot; -- Can shorten this to &quot;He JERKS/TUGS/HAULS Cobb close.&quot; Six words to four. Not worth it, you say. </b></span><br /><br />Yep.<br /><br />I like the visual it creates.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>BANK<br /><br />The townsfolk frozen in place. Unbreathing. Praying for this to end.<br /><br />BLACK<br /><br />tosses the last canvas bag through the air and<br /><br />WHITE<br /><br />catches it, GRUNTING with effort. </b></span><br /><br />This is very close to how it was originally written - but yeah, I love the way the current version quickly leads your mind&#039;s eye through the room. &nbsp;Simple, brief sentences with simple words.<br /><br />Also, this does not, has not, and will not ever offend directors or anyone else. &nbsp;On the contrary, reading a truly visual, cinematic script that really feels like a movie on paper INSPIRES readers. &nbsp;So yeah, don&#039;t be afraid to write the shots and edit each scene through the action lines.<br /><br />Just look at <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.<br /><br />In the drug overdose scene, midpoint in the movie, Vincent attempts to revive Mia by stabbing her in the fucking heart with a hypodermic needle filled with adrenalin. &nbsp;The reason &quot;we hold our breath&quot; is because the script is written &quot;already edited.&quot; &nbsp;In this case it is edited to &quot;milk the scene&quot; and thereby pump up suspense.<br /><br />And even though Vincent counts out three seconds, it takes ¾ of a page for the moment to take place or 45 seconds of screen time.<br /><br />Sometimes you have to go vertical.<br /><br />(by the way, I&#039;m not comparing my shit to <i>Pulp Fiction</i> - just to be clear)<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The use of leading dashes works great.</b></span><br /><br />Tony Gilroy.<br /><br />He&#039;s the master at that shit.<br /><br />And you know what&#039;s also great? &nbsp;Fragments. &nbsp;They create white space and break up the monotony of long sentences.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The unmasking didn&#039;t play right in my mind&#039;s eye. And I reckon we can safely lose Six Foot&#039;s last line of dialogue and instead button the scene on:<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Tom rises, strolls toward the stairwell.<br /><br />SIX FOOT SIX<br /><br />Frozen. Not knowing quite WHAT to think. </b></span><br /><br />Yes, you&#039;re right, there&#039;s no need for Six Foot Six&#039;s last line - but you&#039;ll be happy to know it was also cut in the later draft. &nbsp;And yeah, I&#039;ve never really cared much for the unmasking, either. &nbsp;Never hit right.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>&quot;INT. BRICKWORK - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT&quot; -- Slight problem. We just cut from Tom and Red leaving the bank roof to Tom and Red in a corridor. Somewhere. Those paying attention can join the dots: Six Foot told Tom and Red &#039;she&#039; is holed up &#039;in Brickwork.&#039;</b></span><br /><br />This was also fixed in the later draft. &nbsp;&quot;In Brickwork&quot; -- was changed to &quot;Brickwork Hotel.&quot; &nbsp;With an added shot of the town and them approaching the hotel so that you could see the fruit pushcart and Isabel pacing in a window.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>TOM<br /><br />kicks the door in. It EXPLODES off its top hinges and hangs disabled. Seamlessly continues his momentum and rushes through.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />to something like...<br /><br />-----<br /><br />TOM<br /><br />KICKS -- the door EXPLODES off its top hinges and hangs disabled. Momentum rushing him through into -- </b></span><br /><br />Would like to hear others thoughts.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>I found this confusing for a moment. The guard races across the room &#039;for the rear, heading for Tom.&#039;</b></span><br /><br />I mean, come on. &nbsp;How the fuck did I not catch this? &nbsp;This is just bad writing on my part - Isabel is the one racing towards the rear. <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>&quot;... claustrophobic recess&quot; -- again, this felt unnecessary. How do we know the recess is tiny if it&#039;s veiled in shadow? And it can&#039;t be too claustrophobic if it&#039;s large enough to shelter a horse. Although from the horse&#039;s viewpoint, yeah, that tight squeeze will be claustrophobic, no question. </b></span><br /><br />You answered your own question.<br /><br />Also, since when does shadow equal no light?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>I realise the author is shifting stylistic gears here with the &#039;AND TOM... AND ISABEL&#039; but I&#039;m not convinced it works any better than the regular (and briefer) character subslugging. If it works for you then mentally reinstate those ANDs.</b></span><br /><br />Again, I&#039;d also like to know if this messed with anybody. &nbsp;Not something I do very often.<br /><br />So anyway, I still hate the script. &nbsp;I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s that interesting. &nbsp;Sure, the action is sorta fun - but what else is there? &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;But I look forward to seeing what others have to say.</div>
