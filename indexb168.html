					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />Evening,<br /><br />Thank you, fellow writers who tuned in to my posts - humbling - forever valued. <br /><br />Re: Slugs and action<br /><br />Ditto to number 3 side street example.<br /><br />Laboured thud: “...go with the former.”&nbsp; An apology to Pitchpatch, and to anyone else, for any inadvertent ambiguity on my part that might have higgledy-piggledy labyrinthed them to the same section.&nbsp; I can&#039;t help but wonder, had I armed you up front with more character detail, there might have been no mistaken turn.&nbsp; I saw no need at the time.&nbsp; I rather wish I had.<br /><br />It has plagued my conscience that, as someone who takes all aspects of writing seriously, I could have made such a blunder (not double proofreading before sending).&nbsp; What would a reader have made of it (along with my questionable punctuation) - a definite pass.&nbsp; To save myself from possibly being sent to forum-Coventry, for my faux pas, I hope the following will redeem me:<br /><br />Yardstick&#039;s slight stature and build landed him his nickname.&nbsp; In sharp contrast to Yardstick, the crony is a whacking big overweight lug of a heavy.&nbsp; I felt that the villain’s tower-block build would be understood immediately by his larger-than-average shoe size.&nbsp; I was obviously mistaken.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be simpler to just up shoe size thirteen to... (?), before he becomes fully visual.<br /><br />Yes, indeed, Yardstick is being hotly chased.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pitchpatch&#039;s train of thought gave me food for thought.&nbsp; Considering that since Yardstick is already seen active in the first visual of the sequence with no sound cue beforehand, could it then not follow that featherweight Yardstick&#039;s tread is cotton wool, no matter what his condition?<br /><br />Puffed out, the humongous henchman slows, feeling himself cumbersome, heavier-footed, hence &#039;laboured&#039; thud.&nbsp; As much as I like ‘laboured,’ I would happily reconsider in favour of a wiser, compatible alternative.<br /><br />Re: Acronym/s in dialogue <br /><br />I pray this doesn&#039;t become a screenwriting habit, but again I failed to clarify how the problematic situation arose.&nbsp; During online screenwriting research: &#039;No acronyms in dialogue.&#039;&nbsp; (Vera says ECT twice in the same scene). <br /><br />So, then, if that’s the case, for ECT do I write e-c-t or...ect.&nbsp; Whichever, it still appeared an acronym.&nbsp; That’s what the &quot;problem&quot; - now solved, thanks - was at the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Re: 3-Act structure vs. 4-Act structure <br /><br />The idea of four-act structure is certainly appears more appealing than the three act. IMO.<br /><br />We all know the need for act breaks in theatre, but I had no idea act breaks stretched to their inclusion in screenplays, let alone the importance of them, other than facilitate ad breaks.&nbsp; Keeping within the realms of any recognised act format might have proved difficult for me anyway.<br />When I resume work on the rewrite of my current screenplay spec script draft, I have a mind to focus primarily on plot and story for my opening pages, before the anxiety of conforming to vital structure.<br /><br />If Aristotle invented three-act structure, who devised four-act, and when?&nbsp; Are both paradigms acceptable in the movie world?&nbsp; <br /><br />+++++++<br /><br />Still a newbie to forums, I remain unfamiliar with protocol, jargon, abbreviations, etc.&nbsp; Nevertheless, a couple of handy ones I have learnt through this screenwriting forum: IMO, BTW.&nbsp; But there are one or two I cannot decipher - my own interpretation could be totally wrong (daft, embarrassing even) - for example “PM”?&nbsp; I do, however, look forward to picking up more useful short forms as I bob up and down on board this forum’s ghost ship, hopefully not all alone - so easily spooked..<br /><br />We have a tendency - could be genetic - to rise up from mildly unpleasant or horrific life experiences, with effortless buoyancy, when youth prevails - water off a duck’s back, moving on… and on and on and on, all the time in the world to fix hangovers from the past.&nbsp; But, further down the line, it can become more a case of heave yourself up, before a fleck of dust can settle, march on, head held high, until again someone knocks the wind out of your sails, floors you flat out on your face. <br /><br />Just received an annual subscription reminder from my writers’ organisation.&nbsp; <br />Not long before I came across this screenwriting forum, I was in need of help.&nbsp; Where in the slug to place the name of a new city?&nbsp; No writers in my circle, who better to turn to than an ally, the writers’ organisation to which I belong.&nbsp; Left my first ten pages to ring them.&nbsp; I found myself the Petitioner in Victoria Lynn Schmidt’s The 55 Dramatic Situations, pg. 103.<br /><br />FIVE MINUTES INTO MY “MAYDAY” TELEPHONE CALL: <br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: (V.O.) Does it have to be a different city?<br />PETITIONER: As I’ve already explained, the protagonist’s life depends on it.&nbsp; He doesn’t want to die.&nbsp; Can you tell me where in the master scene heading to put the name of the new city, please?<br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: (V.O.) It doesn’t have to be a different city.<br />PETITIONER: (staying calm) His life’s at stake.&nbsp; He has no choice but to flee.<br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: (V.O.) Not easy for you.<br />PETITIONER: Allow me to worry about that.&nbsp; I don’t mind a challenge.&nbsp; Can you please answer the question for my first ten pages, which you must know are crucial to get right?<br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: (V.O.) You’re making it difficult.<br />PETITIONER: (biting tongue) I can handle it.&nbsp; Are you interested in writing,at all?<br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: (silence)……………….<br />PETITIONER: Are you there?<br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: (silence)<br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: (V.O.) (suddenly) Be quick, I have people to contact!<br />PETITIONER: (feeling less than human) You’ve changed the subject.&nbsp; No disrespect, but I don’t think you’re being very helpful.<br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: (V.O.) I’m trying to help.<br />PETITIONER: I’m sorry, but I don’t think that you are.&nbsp; I don’t sense you on my side.&nbsp; I really have to press on - I still have to research the place that my main character is running to, but first I need to sort out where in the slug to put the new city name, his preferred place to escape to and for his own motives - I do know the city name sits within a parenthetical.&nbsp; I called you because there is no-one else to help fill in the rest, and I don’t want to get it wrong, my punctuation might let me down as it is.<br />POWER IN AUTHORITY: You can’t write about a place you’ve never been to.<br />PETITIONER: I’m going to ring off now, before you upset me further. Goodbye. (hangs up)<br /><br />*The above is how the awful “finger wagging ‘no-no’” spewed forth from the raw tip of my virgin-to-screenwriting-criteria-research lingua, which phrase I declare will no longer be used, especially as&nbsp; the reminder only serves to punch me in the face again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nevertheless, the recollection of, now renounced, FWNN, still beggars belief.&nbsp; I was itching to get back to my rewrite, before making that call.&nbsp; Now, as my current lot of research draws to a close, days, days, days, even more days have passed since I left my first ten pages to call “Power In Authority”, who felled me.&nbsp; Shortly after the call, the letterbox creaked as it gave way to their annual subscription reminder.<br /><br />I’m still scraping myself off the floor like some cartoon character flattened by goliath force - splattered across every white space on the pages of my first ‘ten’ pages, if not the whole script - block-black the lot. <br /><br />Sorry to end on a blue note.&nbsp; I’m not wallowing in self-pity - never been one to let life’s downs pull me in the same negative direction…well, maybe not for more than five, ten seconds.<br /><br />But, seriously, I do know the dread that I have to overcome when I return to continue my screenplay rewrite, the first few pages, in particular writing the new city name in the slug - it will all come back to haunt me, this “Petitioner”: can there be a dry eye left in the house? LOL. (Hope it stands for what I think it might.).&nbsp; <br /><br />Left none the wiser, I had to make an educated guess regarding the slug and placement of the new city name, so I need to ask, is “LOL” correctly placed?&nbsp; Or should it be: “Can there be a dry eye left in the house, LOL.”?..smiley face.&nbsp; I don’t know how to produce one.<br /><br />Best,<br />infamous<br /><br />Quill flow…<br /><br />Before the character journey, comes the writer’s journey - yours, mine, be it good, bad or so-so.&nbsp; As we write, strive to write, the quill flows, forever traversing the wordsmith’s treacherous terrain, turning every rock thrown into a stepping stone, crossing every rejection in every optimistic stride, until again the unforeseeeable crashes you to lie - mighty quill force-wrung dry.<br /><br />Intrepidmouse aka Infamous</div>
