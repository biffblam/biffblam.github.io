					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Scott Myers at Go Into the Story (https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/spec-script-deals-mid-2017-report-f098f3e46fdb) posted his regular spec deals summary for January through June, 2017. &nbsp;Let&#039;s take a look. &nbsp;I&#039;ll cherry-pick the ones I think are terrific and the ones I think need work.&nbsp; I won&#039;t review all 34, but I will slowly chip away at the list for a couple days, see how far we get.<br /><br />Kicking off with...<br /><br />(http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Dark-Souls-3/pvp_area_dks3-dlc.jpg)<br /><br />Title: Slayer<br /><br />Writer: Joel Dorland, @joeldorland<br /><br /><b>Logline: A simple fisherman who, when his wife is kidnapped and his village slaughtered, trains for 20 years to become the greatest warrior alive in order to wreak vengeance on the four demonic knights responsible.</b><br /><br />-----<br /><br />It&#039;s a crisp, black-and-white LL. &nbsp;Overall, I love it. &nbsp;It promises popcorn action from FADE IN to OUT.<br /><br />There are things about the LL structure that make me itch. &nbsp;&quot;... who, when..., trains...&quot; feels like unnecessarily convoluted grammar, ducking and weaving to get from A to B. &nbsp;The passive &quot;is kidnapped&quot; warrants scrutiny -- always take a second look at passive language to make sure it&#039;s there for a purpose. &nbsp;And &quot;in order to&quot; always gives me a sense of cold, mechanical efficiency. &nbsp;The shorter &quot;to&quot; and &quot;so&quot; do a perfectly fine job without the sterility.<br /><br />I wonder about the setting. &nbsp;The only indicators are &quot;demon knights&quot; and the title itself. &nbsp;These tilt toward fantasy, maybe folklore, or likely medieval. &nbsp;The possibility of Modern-day ignites my imagination more than the other settings, being harder to pull off. &nbsp;A sense of setting/period here could help the LL.<br /><br />The story&#039;s not really about getting revenge on the demonic knights, right? &nbsp;I mean, yes, that&#039;s what happens at the end, and that&#039;s what motivates the protag from start to finish, same as STAR WARS is all about blowing up the Death Star. &nbsp;But this logline suggests the real story -- the journey, not the destination -- is all about the protag fighting worthy and increasingly challenging opponents across those 20 years of training. &nbsp;That&#039;s what we&#039;ll see on screen for most of those 90+ minutes, I&#039;m guessing. &nbsp;The battle with the demonic knights will come in the final Act. &nbsp;We probably won&#039;t see them much during the middle.<br /><br />So, let&#039;s experiment with placing more focus on the journey rather than the destination...<br /><br /><b>Logline: A simple fisherman trains 20 years and fights 20 enemies to become the greatest warrior alive before seeking vengeance on the demonic knights who kidnapped his wife.</b><br /><br />(Reduced by seven words)<br /><br />That&#039;s what he&#039;ll be doing across the movie: fighting, fighting, and more fighting. &nbsp;It&#039;s implied in the original LL, of course, but diluted, I think, because of &quot;trains&quot; with no mention of &quot;fights.&quot; &nbsp;Conceivably, he could train with little actual fighting, which could be a dull and tedious affair.<br /><br />For me, the added detail of &quot;trains 20 years, fights 20 opponents&quot; brings structure and order to that long training period. &nbsp;It gives the reader an expectation, a road map, something to muse over: these 20 enemies, presumably all unique and uniquely dangerous. &nbsp;And the implied cadence of a fight capping each year of training: an annual test of worthiness before he can start training for the next unique confrontation. &nbsp;That&#039;s pretty good scaffolding around this &quot;hero undergoes extreme training for revenge&quot; story.<br /><br />I omitted &quot;slaughtered village&quot; for brevity and because it&#039;s secondary to the overshadowing and more personal &quot;wife kidnapped&quot; motivation.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not read Joel&#039;s screenplay. &nbsp;My extrapolation could be muddy boots tracking across his pristine as-is story. &nbsp;Nevertheless, if the movie is about the journey then I&#039;d like to get a taste of that in the logline.<br /><br /></div>

He then needs to race to save both he and his sister before they meet their demise.</b><br /><br />-----<br /><br />Simple high concept. &nbsp;Clearly written. &nbsp;No challenging aspects. &nbsp;An easy LL win -- and there&#039;s no disgrace in that. &nbsp;I have three comments:<br /><br />&quot;... a new game app... once they enter the game...&quot; -- 10PTT readers know I dislike repetition. &nbsp;&quot;Don&#039;t tell us something we already know&quot; is my mantra. &nbsp;Furthermore, don&#039;t tell us something we&#039;ll very likely assume or figure out ourselves. &nbsp;Doing so wastes valuable LL length.<br /><br />&quot;... race to save...&quot; is one of those vague &quot;insert your imagination here&quot; phrases I really don&#039;t like. &nbsp;Why be vague when explaining your through-line? &nbsp;Sure, sometimes you need to hide key story developments. &nbsp;You can reveal too much in a LL, leave no intrigue, no reason for the reader to scream &quot;I gotta know what happens next!&quot; &nbsp;But let me tell you, being vague will hurt all but the craftiest loglines.<br /><br />&quot;... before they meet their demise.&quot; &nbsp;There&#039;s a time to be cute and play with words. &nbsp;This is not the time. &nbsp;What&#039;s at stake is Death. &nbsp;Let it hit hard like a slap, not like a cluster of colorful balloons gently bumping into the reader.<br /><br />BONUS: &quot;... to save both he and his sister...&quot; -- ugh, just no. &nbsp;&quot;He and his sister&quot; is correct for the subject of a subject-verb-object sentence. &nbsp;I would argue the correct grammar in this case as written is &quot;... to save both himself and his sister...&quot; &nbsp;In any case it feels clunky, so let&#039;s write around it.<br /><br /><b>Logline: When a &nbsp;journalist discovers the hot new app he&#039;s playing with his sister kills in real life, he has 60 minutes to beat the game or they both die.</b><br /><br />Boom. &nbsp;35 words down to 29. &nbsp;Protag, antag, stakes -- and we added a ticking clock for urgency. &nbsp;Despite this being a fairly rote high concept, punching up the LL gives it a delicious sting. &nbsp;The LL promises a fast, thrilling, zig-zagging story. &nbsp;The script sold, so Teddy and Minsun must&#039;ve delivered the goods. &nbsp;Great job!</div>

(Now do you believe me?)<br /><br /><b>Logline: Diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, a legendary retired assassin returns for one final job to secure her young daughter&#039;s future.</b><br /><br />Too easy. &nbsp;35 words crushed down to 20. &nbsp;Zipped that sucker with brutal efficiency. &nbsp;Let&#039;s hit the slow-mo button and review how we compressed the LL by removing redundant information:<br /><br />1. We restructured to lose the passive &quot;... is diagnosed with...&quot;<br /><br />2. We saved a big chunk by reducing &quot;... she must return to the life she left behind... &quot; to just &quot;returns.&quot; &nbsp;It all hinges on the preceding use of &quot;retired.&quot; &nbsp;That&#039;s the only word we need to understand, in context, that &quot;returns&quot; means she&#039;s going back to her old job. &nbsp;The &quot;must&quot; we intuit from the inescapable bookends of &quot;terminal brain cancer&quot; and &quot;secure her daughter&#039;s future.&quot; &nbsp;We understand without elaboration that the clock is ticking.<br /><br />3. We simplified the bejesus out of lots of stuff: &quot;... and complete one final job...&quot; becomes &quot;... for one final job...&quot;; &quot;... in order to...&quot; shrivels to &quot;... to...&quot;; &quot;... a future for her young daughter&quot; packs neatly into &quot;... her young daughter&#039;s future.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s how we shaved 43% off the original length, without losing any substance. &nbsp;The edits do nothing to make the LL more original, but at least it really zings now and doesn&#039;t overstay its welcome.<br /><br />[EDIT] Um, did I forget something? &nbsp;Rereading this post some days later, why yes, yes I did. &nbsp;I promised to wedge a little opposition in there, and never mind how the LL is already packed tighter than a Japanese commuter train. &nbsp;Let me get right on that now.<br /><br /><b>Logline: Dying from brain cancer, a legendary retired assassin takes one last job to secure her young daughter&#039;s future: kill the Russian spy she once married.</b><br /><br />Wait! &nbsp;Hey, you can&#039;t stop there! &nbsp;The Russian guy, the target -- if she married him and she&#039;s got a daughter, does that mean what I think it means? &nbsp;She&#039;s going after the man who fathered her daughter?<br /><br />Ambiguity ain&#039;t all bad -- when used deliberately.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How about a twofer?&nbsp; One writer gazing into the sunset of his career; the other basking in a golden dawn...<br /><br />(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Juan-Diego.jpg)<br /><br />Title: Our Lady of Guadalupe<br /><br />Writer: Joe Eszterhas<br /><br /><b>Logline: In 1531, the visitation of the Virgin Mary in a small town in Mexico leads a humble man named Juan Diego to push the local bishop to get a temple erected in her name.</b><br /><br />-----<br /><br />There&#039;s little to do here.&nbsp; It&#039;s a respectable -- if uninspiring -- logline.&nbsp; Period and place, inciting incident, a protag with a characteristic, a likely antagonist in the bishop, and a clear goal.<br /><br />As with the UNFIT logline, I had to consult google to learn Juan Diego&#039;s true story (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Diego).<br /><br />Perhaps some verbs can be punched up: &quot;inspires&quot; or &quot;drives&quot; for the insipid &quot;leads&quot;; &quot;urge&quot; or &quot;implore&quot; in place of &quot;push.&quot;&nbsp; And I would go with &quot;... to erect a temple in her name&quot; over &quot;... to get a temple erected in her name.&quot;&nbsp; Let&#039;s try it...<br /><br /><b>Logline: In 1531, the visitation of the Virgin Mary in a small town in Mexico inspires a humble man named Juan Diego to urge the local bishop to erect a temple in her name.</b><br /><br />To me, the through-line still feels oddly indirect and kind of bureaucratic.&nbsp; It&#039;s like if somebody got inspired to cross the Atlantic paddling a canoe and the first thing they do is hire a pro canoeist to perform the feat by proxy.&nbsp; Similarly, this logline does not seem as strong compared to the one where Juan struggles to erect the temple with his own hands.<br /><br /><br />-----<br /><br />(http://media.2oceansvibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/kidnap.jpg)<br /><br />Title: The Claim<br /><br />Writer: Damien Chazelle<br /><br /><b>Logline: A single father with a criminal background must uncover the whereabouts of his kidnapped daughter while fighting the mysterious claims of another couple who insist that the child is theirs.</b><br /><br />-----<br /><br />Not a problem to whittle this down to its essence, thanks to &quot;uncover the whereabouts&quot; and &quot;another couple who insist that the child is theirs.&quot;<br /><br /><b>Logline: A single father with a criminal past must find his kidnapped daughter while fighting a mysterious couple who claim the child is theirs.</b><br /><br />(7 words vaporized from 30.)<br /></div>

Build your logline with bright and colorful pieces cut from sturdy paperboard and people will want to discover the big picture.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">(https://i1.wp.com/www.nowverybad.com/wp-content/uploads/the_matrix_still14.jpg)<br /><br />Title: Infinite<br /><br />Writer: Ian Shorr, @IanShorr<br /><br /><b>Logline: A schizophrenic discovers his hallucinations are actually memories of past lives that he can access as well as the skills he possessed in those time periods.</b> <br /><br />-----<br /><br />Instantly evokes ASSASSIN&#039;S CREED. &nbsp;We won&#039;t dwell on whether that&#039;s a good or bad thing.<br /><br />It&#039;s a limber logline, coiled tight within those 26 words. &nbsp;The LL describes the sword, not the person wielding the sword -- meaning we have the MacGuffin but no story. &nbsp;Usually that would worry me greatly. &nbsp;But this thing pricks the imagination and draws blood. &nbsp;Sometimes it&#039;s enough for a logline to do nothing more than yank your crank a couple times. &nbsp;<br /><br />I feel the end can be tightened. &nbsp;The first reveal about the memories is Cinderella-good. &nbsp;The passive &quot;that he can access&quot; and its sibling &quot;as well as...&quot; bumble into view, arm in arm, like two ugly step-sisters.<br /><br />How about:<br /><br /><b>Logline: A schizophrenic discovers his hallucinations are really memories of a hundred past lives -- with skills he can use.</b><br /><br />And still we managed to lop off eight words. &nbsp;One thing I don&#039;t want to lose is the sense of these past lives scattered throughout history, and the many different time periods traversed. &nbsp;That rich variety is what makes this premise appealing. &nbsp;A soldier in Rome, a soldier in the Wild West, a soldier in WWII -- basically the same skill set. &nbsp;We don&#039;t want that. &nbsp;An Edo-period Japanese chef, a Summer of Love New Zealand pearl diver, a 1920s getaway driver -- that is the delicious, spicy brew we want filling our cups.<br /><br />I&#039;m counting on &quot;memories of a hundred past lives&quot; to create that sense of historical latitude. &nbsp;Hopefully your mind does the math intuitively: 100 x 50 (factoring for life expectancy and unnatural endings) suggests a five-millennia slice of history. &nbsp;That&#039;s a vast historical canvas. &nbsp;Too vast?<br /><br />The story title &quot;Infinite&quot; makes me wonder if Ian really does leave the door wide open, imposing no limits on how far back these past lives go. &nbsp;I would be concerned about that. &nbsp;Limits are good. &nbsp;Limits and story rules create a retaining wall your characters can (and should) bump into. &nbsp;Limitless stories -- e.g. characters with limitless resources -- leave no room for suspense, for surprise, for empathy. &nbsp;Neo finds a kind of limitless power only at the end of THE MATRIX. &nbsp;I expect Ian follows a similar path here.<br /></div>
