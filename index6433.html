					Title: <b>Spec Script Sale: &quot;Tipping Point&quot;</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Relativity Media buys action-thriller spec script &quot;Tipping Point&quot; from writer Todd Stein. Via It&#039;s On The Grid:<br />Based on his original short story, set a blink into the future, New York cop Solomon is part of an elite police division hunting those who break the Zero Population Act of2027. A routine stop alters Solomon’s life forever when he uncovers the woman he once loved had an illegal child… his son. Now a criminal himself, Solomon must protect his family from the very task force he works for as he races thru New York to find a way out.<br />Script is based on a short story Stein wrote and was posted on the website Popcorn Fiction. The site is hosted by screenwriter-novelist Derek Haas, so here is a case where one screenwriter helped create some heat for another screenwriter. Which is to say congrats to Mr. Stein and good on you, Mr. Haas!<br /><br />Stein is repped by WME and Industry Entertainment Partners.<br /><br />By my count, this is the 37th spec script sale to sell in 2011.<br /><br />The 37th spec didn&#039;t sell in 2010 until September 23rd. <br /><br />The spec market is now more than 4 months ahead of last year&#039;s sale pace.<br /><br />[gointothestory.com]</div>
