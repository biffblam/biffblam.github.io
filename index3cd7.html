					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Freddie&#039;s (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Wong) back.<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoYVfdP0oOc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />The trailer doesn&#039;t wow me. &nbsp;That&#039;s a missed opportunity for a great first impression. &nbsp;It&#039;s Ashly Burch, so that puts some sizzle on the steak. It&#039;s weird how this trailer skips much of the meat in Freddie&#039;s logline on his IMDB (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28055078/) page. &nbsp;Freddie included two loglines, actually:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">In near future, everyone&#039;s gotten used to the 10,000-mile alien tentacle that materialized in the sky, and a struggling beekeeper and a grieving wanderer must join together and take a dangerous roadtrip to get their teleported stuff back.</div><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">In the near future, a towering alien &quot;spike&quot; materializes in Earth&#039;s atmosphere, wreaking havoc. Years later, it&#039;s still around. A struggling beekeeper is forced to team up with an emotionally raw EMT on a roadtrip to retrieve her bees (and his car) after their stuff is suddenly teleported across the country by the alien spike.</div><br />What bugs me most about both is the very tenuous link between the Spike and teleportation. &nbsp;You have to wait until the end of the logline to understand the connection.<br /><br />Combining the two, and ignoring the trailer, we learn:<br /><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Everyone has adapted to the 10,000-mile alien tentacle (the Spike) that appeared in the sky years ago.</li><li>Stuff it touches gets teleported vast distances.</li><li>Our two-hander is (1) a struggling beekeeper, and (2) a grieving EMT. &nbsp;When the Spike sends her bees and his car across the country, they take a forced roadtrip to get their stuff back.</li></ul><br />That is one crazy long tentacle. &nbsp;Ten thousand miles is about 16,000 km. &nbsp;The Karman line is roughly 100 km above earth. &nbsp;A tentacle 160 times that distance suggests to me an alien creature so big it blots out the sun for the whole planet. &nbsp;But I digress...<br /><br />Bullet point 1 is kind of there with the male lead&#039;s casual acceptance. &nbsp;But we see this nowhere else. The general tone suggests pre-Spike and post-Spike are not hugely different. &nbsp;A couple other quick examples of this indifference from others characters would help.<br /><br />Bullet 2 is... nowhere to be found. &nbsp;Not shown, not mentioned. &nbsp;Keeping those gags under wraps, maybe. The consequence is us having no clue what danger the Spike poses. &nbsp;We see vague hints of destruction, with none of those directly tied to the Spike. &nbsp;There is no cause and effect.<br /><br />The final bullet point is another mixed bag. &nbsp;&quot;Struggling beekeeper&quot; We understand she&#039;s stressed out and uptight, but over what? &nbsp;The Spike? &nbsp;Her teleported bees? -- wait, we don&#039;t know the Spike teleports things because it&#039;s never shown or discussed, so how would we know it&#039;s that?<br /><br />&quot;Grieving EMT&quot; -- again, how would we know? No part of this trailer shows him grieving.<br /><br />&quot;... sends her bees and his car across the country...&quot; -- SCENE OMITTED. &nbsp;We have NO idea why these two are forced to roadtrip together. &nbsp;In the trailer it just happens. &nbsp;In the logline it&#039;s clear: &quot;to get my car/bees back.&quot;<br /><br />The trailer makes the mistake of opening with them already together. &nbsp;A later scene makes it clear they are &quot;total strangers&quot;, but we&#039;ve already connected them from that first shot, so it doesn&#039;t feel like their lives abrupty and forcefully intersect to kick off the roadtrip.<br /><br />Freddie&#039;s first logline mentions a &quot;dangerous roadtrip.&quot; &nbsp;Again, we kinda see that in the trailer with the rifle-toting lady confronting our couple. &nbsp;But there&#039;s nothing remarkable about her reaction. It&#039;s commonplace in our contempory world, never mind a future with a giant alien tentacle wandering across the sky.<br /><br />Okay. &nbsp;I&#039;m done complaining about that trailer. &nbsp;Back to the logline. &nbsp;Let&#039;s blend Freddie&#039;s two loglines into a better one, and we&#039;ll use our three bullet points to do it.<br /><br />The trailer gives nothing away about the nature of the alien tentacle aka the Spike. &nbsp;Is it a permanent slowly roaming thing? &nbsp;Does it appear and disappear? &nbsp;In the trailer we see it pulse and slowly feather like lightning, so perhaps it randomly appears and disappears, leaving a trail of unavoidable destruction. &nbsp;Anyway, we can ignore this. &nbsp;No need to clutter the logline. &nbsp;It&#039;s already a lot to take in.<br /><br /><b>&quot;Everyone&#039;s use to the giant sky tentacle probing earth and teleporting things. When &quot;the Spike&quot; zaps a beekeeper&#039;s hives and an EMT&#039;s car across country, they go on a dangerous roadtrip to fetch their stuff.&quot;</b><br /><br />Thirty-five crisp, easy to digest words. &nbsp;First we set up the Spike and what it does. &nbsp;Then we use it to set the story in motion. &nbsp;We jettison &quot;struggling&quot; and &quot;grieving&quot; because we don&#039;t need that fine detail in this logline. &nbsp;&quot;The Spike&quot; is the star, the secret sauce, the draw card. &nbsp;That&#039;s what hooks &#039;em, then you put &#039;em under your spell by layering the emotional journey on top of the roadtrip.</div>
