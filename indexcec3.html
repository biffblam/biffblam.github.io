					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">PAGE 1<br /><br />1.<br /><br />We&#039;re in good hands. &nbsp;Dylan and Greg know how to build mood fast with simple pen strokes. &nbsp;You always know by Page 2 if the writer can write. &nbsp;Sometimes you know by the first paragraph.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting that sinking, excited, disappointed, happy feeling that announces I&#039;ll be a bystander for most of this 10PTT. &nbsp;It&#039;s kind of a bummer. &nbsp;I like to play the hero. &nbsp;I like to rescue oppressed ideas and weak images from their shackles on the page. &nbsp;When I know right away the writing is good, that I should get the hell out of its way, I do feel a bit redundant. <br /><br />This first establishing paragraph sets the scene well. &nbsp;It&#039;s entirely visual though. &nbsp;Well, no, it&#039;s tactile too: &quot;muggy... thick with moisture... crushes...&quot; &nbsp;What does a Florida night sound like? &nbsp;I don&#039;t know. &nbsp;Do the frogs call? &nbsp;Do the crickets sing? &nbsp;Do trains clatter by in the gloom?<br /><br />Anything on the page beyond what&#039;s there now is gravy. &nbsp;The paragraph does the job. &nbsp;You wouldn&#039;t want to pad it and eat up more white space for no good reason. &nbsp;But maybe we can tease our auditory sense, pull in the reader just that tiny bit more...<br /><br />-----<br />Neat rows of upscale condos stand quiet in the hot Florida night. &nbsp;Frogs croak. &nbsp;Air thick and moist crushes the sodium-yellow street lights to a golden haze.<br />-----<br /><br />Those little tweaks:<br /><br />- &quot;look peaceful&quot; -&gt; &quot;stand quiet.&quot; &nbsp;The first has the condos being acted upon: we&#039;re observing them. &nbsp;The second is the condos being active -- a subtle difference that shifts the tone. &nbsp;Both work. &nbsp;Choose your weapon.<br /><br />- &quot;muggy Florida night&quot; -&gt; &quot;hot Florida night.&quot; &nbsp;We get &quot;muggy&quot; from the &quot;thick&quot; and &quot;moist&quot; air in the next sentence. &nbsp;Where possible, don&#039;t double up on description. &nbsp;Instead, I figured we could emphasize the heat, really drive it home: &quot;hot, thick, moist&quot; versus &quot;muggy, thick, moist&quot;. &nbsp; For me, the former avoids the overlapping adjectives in the latter. &nbsp;Each adjective is discreet, each adds something.<br /><br />- &quot;Frogs croak.&quot; &nbsp;I searched and searched for a non-cliche, clean way of saying the same thing. &nbsp;I found nothing as brief and effective as this two-word cliche. &nbsp;Sometimes you have to give up and embrace the cruel efficiency of cliches. <br /><br />- &quot;Air thick and moist crushes the sodium-yellow street lights to a golden haze.&quot; The changes to this second sentence are trivial and might even rob it of some cadence. &nbsp;I&#039;m undecided. &nbsp;By cutting &quot;the&quot; we eliminate the comma partitions. &nbsp;And I shortened &quot;into&quot;. &nbsp;Does any of this streamline the sentence? &nbsp; It&#039;s so minor. &nbsp;Hard to tell. &nbsp;Like watching a feather land on mousetrap: waiting for the snap. &nbsp;I can tell you we&#039;ve jettisoned three syllables, so there&#039;s that. &nbsp;Less syllables means a smoother, slicker read. &nbsp;(Are you sensing it yet? &nbsp;My dignity draining away, comment by comment. &nbsp;I can feel it. &nbsp;No question about it. &nbsp;I&#039;m afraid. &nbsp;Stop, Dave. &nbsp;I&#039;m afraid...)<br /><br /><br />2.<br /><br />This is good, solid writing. &nbsp;If I were to indulge my urge to nudge the amperage from 10 to 10.5 -- let&#039;s not go all crazy-11 on the dial just yet -- it would be this: &nbsp;The girl wears pajamas, eats ice cream, shops online. &nbsp;Is it possible we can bring some color to how she wears, how she eats, how she shops? &nbsp;How does one portray &quot;shy and sweet&quot; with these activities? &nbsp;Okay, with &quot;sweet&quot; the actress can sell it with wardrobe and mannerisms. &nbsp;But &quot;shy&quot;? &nbsp;Who&#039;s she being shy for? &nbsp; People grow shy when they&#039;re self-conscious. &nbsp;People usually aren&#039;t self-conscious when they&#039;re alone. &nbsp;So I&#039;m thinking: let it play. &nbsp;We don&#039;t need a sign around her neck announcing &quot;Hello. &nbsp;I am sweet and shy.&quot; &nbsp;Let her words and actions reveal it.<br /><br />Look, I know. &nbsp;We get what &quot;shy and sweet&quot; means, both on the page and on screen. &nbsp;All crew departments will deliver the visual cues without breaking a sweat. &nbsp;We&#039;ll see her hair tied up. &nbsp;Her face make-up free. &nbsp;Her movements will be light and bouncy, her expression pleasant. &nbsp;The cinema machine knows down to the last freckle how to give the audience &quot;sweet and shy.&quot;<br /><br />But that&#039;s the crew. &nbsp;That&#039;s another day. &nbsp;What about here, now, on the page for the reader? &nbsp;Can&#039;t we toss the reader a little somethin&#039; somethin&#039; to feed their imagination?<br /><br />-----<br />A girl (25) in cartoon-print pajamas spoons ice cream and shops for skis on eBay.<br />-----<br /><br />That&#039;s 27 words down to 15. &nbsp;And quite likely this will fit on a single line, saving two. &nbsp;We&#039;ve condensed all the necessary info, transformed the paragraph from noisy shotgun blast to whisper-smooth sniper bullet. &nbsp;(ORLY, Pitchpatch? &nbsp;Yes, I&#039;m being ridiculous. &nbsp;You don&#039;t come here much, do you?) &nbsp;Adding the &quot;cartoon-print pajamas&quot; hopefully ups the cute factor. &nbsp;I&#039;m tempted to go further: &quot;... in oversized cartoon-print pajamas...&quot; &nbsp;Those too-long sleeve cuffs flopping about when not forcibly pushed up past her wrists. &nbsp;Adorable. &nbsp;The shyness will have to come out in a later scene.<br /><br />With &quot;shops for skis on eBay&quot; we directed without directing. &nbsp;We know there&#039;ll be an insert shot showing the laptop/tablet browser open at eBay. &nbsp; A long form way of writing this on the page would be:<br /><br />-----<br />A girl (25) in cartoon-print pajamas spoons ice cream and shops online.<br /><br />HER WEB BROWSER<br /><br />displays an eBay listing for expensive snow skis.<br />-----<br /><br />There are more ways to handle it, but none as streamlined as &quot;shops for skis on eBay.&quot;<br /><br />See? &nbsp;I&#039;m reduced to this when writers deliver pages with ease. &nbsp;I end up the hysterical one snatching every little crumb. &nbsp;There will be no dignity in this 10PTT, I assure you. &nbsp;Not for me. &nbsp;I&#039;ll be forced to do things, say things... things a self-respecting man should never say. &nbsp;Things you won&#039;t ever erase from memory. &nbsp;Oh, but you&#039;ll try. &nbsp;You&#039;ll wish this place we&#039;re going had a delete button. &nbsp;That click you heard was the central locking. &nbsp;The doors and windows are now secure. &nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t want any accidents along the way if, say, somebody got the idea to throw themselves out of a moving vehicle.<br /><br />All right. &nbsp;We&#039;re gassed up and ready to go. &nbsp;Let&#039;s inch forward...<br /><br /><br />3.<br /><br />&quot;Pre-furnished&quot; modifies &quot;corporate apartment&quot;, so there&#039;s no comma. &nbsp;Apply the standard test, substituting &quot;and&quot; for the comma: corporate and pre-furnished apartment; pre-furnished and corporate apartment. &nbsp;Neither reads sensibly. &nbsp;Compare to the properly comma-spliced &quot;clean, generic sitting area&quot;: clean and generic sitting area; generic and clean sitting area. &nbsp;No problem there.<br /><br /><br />4.<br /><br />Is it important we see her glance at the TV screen? &nbsp;I don&#039;t think so. &nbsp;We&#039;re told she&#039;s barely paying attention, which means she&#039;s not totally ignoring it. &nbsp;The quick glances are implied. &nbsp;If this particular glance -- just before she mutes the sound -- is important, give us some indication on the page:<br /><br />-----<br />Her cell phone BUZZES on the coffee table. &nbsp;She&#039;s slow to pick up, suddenly giving the TV her full attention. &nbsp;Something about a &quot;brutal killing&quot;...?<br />-----<br /><br />That glance can&#039;t be cut. &nbsp;It&#039;s a character moment. &nbsp;It tells us something. &nbsp;Suddenly the TV report resonates with her. &nbsp;Something triggers in her head to make her pay attention.<br /><br />But, as it exists on the page now, I reckon that glance means nothing. &nbsp;She mutes the TV with the same general indifference she&#039;s demonstrated til now. &nbsp;Cut the glance and save words.<br /><br /><br />5.<br /><br />This is me being brutal. &nbsp;I have this thing -- did you notice? -- about rescuing orphan words from run-over lines. &nbsp;Um, perhaps &quot;rescue&quot; isn&#039;t the right word here. &nbsp;Perhaps &quot;exterminate&quot; is.<br /><br />I warned you: when it comes to words on the page, I&#039;m ruthless. &nbsp;I concede, killing orphans sounds like the worst kind of mustache-twirling villainy. &nbsp;But consider this. &nbsp;The great writer William Faulkner solemnly urged us to kill our darlings. &nbsp;It&#039;s a small stretch to argue that category includes orphans. &nbsp;If you want to argue, go ahead. &nbsp;Me? &nbsp;I don&#039;t fuck with Faulkner.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my reasoning. &nbsp;A line that runs over by one or two words doesn&#039;t have the smooth left-right reading sweep of a sentence or paragraph occupying a single line on &nbsp;the page. &nbsp;With a single line of text you get everything in one sweep of the eye: one brain bite. &nbsp;You arrive at the right-hand margin, you digest your line of text, the narrative grows. &nbsp;Your gaze resets to the left margin, and you&#039;re ready for more. &nbsp;One bite, one swallow.<br /><br />When a single line extends to two, with only one or two words dangling beneath, you&#039;re not done when your eye reaches the right margin after that first line. &nbsp;You put your comprehension on hold. &nbsp;There&#039;s more waiting. &nbsp;You can&#039;t start chewing until you&#039;ve slurped up the entire strand of spaghetti. &nbsp;The narrative stays suspended until you&#039;ve ingested those final few words. &nbsp;So, your gaze zips back to the left margin, you finish the paragraph, and now you&#039;re ready to make sense of this text block. &nbsp;Your brain slips into gear, processes the narrative, and you&#039;re ready for the next line. &nbsp;But that extra bit of arrested comprehension makes a subtle difference to how a script reads. &nbsp;Those tiny narrative speed bumps accumulate and take their toll. &nbsp;Hey, and we haven&#039;t even talked about the benefits of saving whitespace when you doggedly hunt down danglers.<br /><br />You may ask: What about a paragraph that overruns by half a line? &nbsp;Is that equally sinful? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Halfway between good and evil is... meh. &nbsp;As I see it, the &quot;Kill Your Orphans&quot; rule applies only to a last line comprising one or two short words. &nbsp;If the last line is any longer it won&#039;t be easy to trim the paragraph enough to pull in the danglers.<br /><br /><br />6.<br /><br />We&#039;ve got two unnamed women interacting. &nbsp;I&#039;m itching to give &quot;the girl&quot; a tag. &nbsp;Maybe &quot;Pajama Girl&quot; or short-form it to &quot;Pajamas&quot; or even &quot;PJs&quot;.<br /><br />I swapped in &quot;frowns&quot; for &quot;looks&quot; to show Pajama Girl&#039;s state of mind. &nbsp;&quot;Looks&quot; always feels to me like an opportunity to do some coloring between the lines. &nbsp;On film it would be: close on browser window, new high bid pops up, back to Pajama Girl&#039;s annoyed face. &nbsp;So, why not include that on the page?<br /><br />&quot;She&#039;s not the top bid anymore.&quot; -&gt; &quot;She just got outbid.&quot; &nbsp; Stay frosty for opportunities to say the same thing with less words -- unless trimming messes up an awesomely written sentence. &nbsp;Don&#039;t be fanatically spartan just for the hell of it.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">PAGE 2<br /><br />7.<br /><br />Personal taste. &nbsp;If somebody were telling me this story orally, that&#039;s how I&#039;d expect to hear it.<br /><br /><br />8.<br /><br />Call me slow, but initially I thought &quot;(eyes on the prize)&quot; related to what she says: &quot;Somebody has to be.&quot; &nbsp;Then came the uh-huh moment of, Oh, the eBay auction is the prize. &nbsp;It&#039;s a cute wryly. &nbsp;But, me, I&#039;d keep things crystal clear when cute has the potential to derail comprehension: &nbsp;&quot;(eyeing the timer)&quot;<br /><br /><br />9.<br /><br />That&#039;s a suspiciously wide parenthetical y&#039;all got there. &nbsp;Somebody&#039;s been a-cheatin&#039; the ol&#039; format. &nbsp; &nbsp;Take a hard look at long wrylies. &nbsp; They interrupt flow. &nbsp;Usually for good reason, but they do interrupt. &nbsp;So keep them super short. &nbsp;I&#039;d go for &quot;(to someone else)&quot; or maybe the simple 2+2 choice of &quot;(distracted)&quot;.<br /><br /><br />10.<br /><br />&quot;The CLICK of the other line cuts her off.&quot; &nbsp;Just pausing to point out the nicely active sentence construction. &nbsp;Not: &quot;She&#039;s cut off by the CLICK of the other line.&quot;<br /><br /><br />11.<br /><br />Shave off those two words. &nbsp;We understand just as well with them gone. &nbsp;When you cut needless words, you win. &nbsp;Remember that famous quote from the bard: &quot;First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the woman.&quot; &nbsp;Shakespeare knew a thing or two about priorities. &nbsp;And cocaine.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">PAGE 3<br /><br />12.<br /><br />&quot;Behind her, motion-sensing lights illuminate a small backyard.&quot; &nbsp;Okay, we have an ambiguity problem here. &nbsp;If you stop there and read no further, riddle me this: have the lights been on the whole time or have they suddenly activated now? &nbsp;Your answer doesn&#039;t matter; you&#039;re correct either way. &nbsp;The problem is &quot;illuminate&quot;, because it carries both meanings. &nbsp;We need to pin down its superposition to avoid leading the reader astray. &nbsp;Yes, we understand these are motion-sensing lights, so they remain off until triggered by movement. &nbsp;Is it possible the lights have been on for minutes already? &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;The way it&#039;s written makes it a valid interpretation.<br /><br />I believe the intent is for the motion lights to blink on. &nbsp;And there we go: &quot;blink&quot; is a great candidate to replace the ambiguous &quot;illuminate&quot;. &nbsp;Let&#039;s try it:<br /><br />&quot;Behind her, motion-sensing lights blink on, flooding a small backyard.&quot;<br /><br />Or keep &quot;illuminate&quot;: &nbsp;&quot;... motion-sensing lights wink on, illuminating a small backyard.&quot;<br /><br /><br />13.<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna point and shame this sentence: &quot;She turns, then gets up and heads to the sliding glass door to investigate.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s how we all write in an early draft or two, isn&#039;t it? &nbsp;In those early drafts we transcribe from our imagination in excruciating detail. &nbsp;Later, we realize all we need is:<br /><br />&quot;She opens the glass sliding door to investigate.&quot;<br /><br />Implied in that action is: she turns, gets up, crosses the room to the door. &nbsp;There&#039;s no opening that door without doing those mini actions. &nbsp;If we can safely imply the in-between parts, the way an animator keyframes the important moments in a cartoon, then by all means let&#039;s do it, proving the rule &quot;less is more.&quot;<br /><br />Thinking on it more, it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if an editor chopped it down to this:<br /><br />1. WIDE: Pajama Girl FG; security light come on illuminating yard in BG.<br />2. CLOSE on Pajama Girl: her reaction.<br />3. CUT TO: Pajama Girl at glass door, cautiously sliding it open.<br /><br />That little on-screen time cut between 2 and 3 keeps a healthy pace.&nbsp; (&quot;What is drama, after all, but life with the dull bits cut out.&quot;)&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t hurt to shoot it continuously, and maybe the director likes something about the way Pajama Girl moves from the couch to the door.&nbsp; But my money&#039;s on the editor scissoring it.<br /><br />FREEZE FRAME! &nbsp;(Or freeze page or whatever.) &nbsp;There&#039;s something missing here! &nbsp;Describe to me, right now, Pajama Girl&#039;s attitude as she walks to the door then out onto the porch.<br /><br />Again, anything you say is valid, because we don&#039;t have her attitude baked into the action. &nbsp;We can make some reasonable assumptions, of course. &nbsp;We&#039;re not idiots here -- although I play one on TV and in various internet forums.<br /><br />We don&#039;t wait long before her demeanor reveals itself -- &quot;She takes a few tentative steps into the yard&quot; -- confirming what we already suspect: she&#039;s rattled. &nbsp;The movie audience would see this emotion on her face and in her body language soon as those security lights snap on outside and she decides to investigate. &nbsp;Why make the script-reader wait?<br /><br />&quot;She tentatively opens the sliding glass door to investigate.&quot; &nbsp;Now we&#039;re set. &nbsp;One adverb colors all her actions from here on.<br /><br />&quot;She walks onto the porch.&quot; &nbsp;Now we know enough to interpret that &quot;walk&quot; through the focused lens of &quot;tentative&quot;. &nbsp;But, hey, let&#039;s keep that momentum going:<br /><br />-----<br />She tentatively opens the sliding glass door to investigate --<br /><br />BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS<br /><br />-- and creeps onto the porch. &nbsp;Inside, the news rambles on.<br />-----<br /><br />I could very well be screwing up this scene. &nbsp;Maybe the writers wanted her to be cautious but in control, not timid and jumpy. &nbsp;The possibility is duly noted.<br /><br /><br />14.<br /><br />&quot;She turns fast...&quot; &nbsp;We can try out some fitter verbs to do the job of &quot;turns fast&quot;: spins, whirls, reels, wheels, pivots... &nbsp;All of these do a great job describing &quot;turns fast.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;... but doesn&#039;t see anything&quot; i.e. &quot;does not see anything.&quot; &nbsp;That could slim down to: &quot;She whirls, but sees nothing.&quot;<br /><br /><br />15.<br /><br />&quot;Hello?&quot; &nbsp;A LOUD CLATTER.<br /><br />The noise is her answer. &nbsp;Action, reaction. &nbsp;This is a suspenseful scene. &nbsp;Keep the sentences quick and punchy, like Pajama Girl&#039;s racing heartbeat.<br /><br /><br />16.<br /><br />I wanted to be a dick and say, &quot;Is it true the motion detector turns off? &nbsp;No, it&#039;s not true. &nbsp;Not really. &nbsp;What turns off is the light attached to the motion detector. &nbsp;The light turns off when the timer keeping it on runs out. &nbsp;The motion sensor stays on constantly, whether the light is on or off.&quot; &nbsp;See? &nbsp;Dick.<br /><br />Then I realized the joke&#039;s on me. &nbsp;As described, the motion sensor DOES turn off. &nbsp;Because somebody disables it. &nbsp;The proof comes moments later when Pajama Girl flails her arms trying to coax the light back on and nothing happens. &nbsp;(EDIT: Nope, the security light ain&#039;t broke, because it comes on again at scene end. &nbsp;So I have no idea why it doesn&#039;t trigger when she waves her arms.)<br /><br />Nothing at all wrong with this paragraph, but it can be condensed. &nbsp;How about 20 words down to 15. &nbsp;In particular:<br /><br />&quot;... but it doesn&#039;t turn back on&quot; &nbsp;versus &quot;... but it stays off.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s a good example of finding a shorter way to say the same thing. &nbsp;Like I&#039;ve said in other 10PTTs, words are free but they have a cost. &nbsp;(Saywhatnow?) &nbsp;The price is comprehension. &nbsp;Every unnecessary word inflates the time it takes for your reader to digest your spoonfuls (sentences) of story. &nbsp;Yeah, we&#039;re talking nano- and micro-seconds. &nbsp;The speed of thought. &nbsp;Ridiculously tiny the mental pauses may be, they add up across the pages. &nbsp;So keep it slim, Jim. &nbsp;(My dignity needle just dipped into the red. &nbsp;But screw you. &nbsp;Still some reserves left in the tank. &nbsp;I think. &nbsp;Hope that gauge isn&#039;t faulty.)<br /><br /><br />17.<br /><br />I tend to be all &quot;You kids get off my lawn&quot; crotchety when it comes to action busywork like pulling phones out of pockets.<br /><br />&quot;She digs out her phone to use its flashlight, then stumbles for the door.&quot;<br /><br />BOOM! &nbsp;Drop the mic, we&#039;re done here. &nbsp;Skip over as much boring busywork as you can, so long as the context adequately fills in the blanks. &nbsp;That phone came from somewhere on her person. &nbsp; We assume pocket. &nbsp;To use the flashlight feature she has to switch it on first. &nbsp;All of this is 2+2 instead of 2+2=4.<br /><br /><br />18.<br /><br />With a flick of the scalpel we nip and tuck, and a two-liner becomes a one-liner.<br /><br />A very minor observation: the simplest word forms are easiest to read and quickest to comprehend. &nbsp;Case in point:<br /><br />&quot;She yelps, dropping her phone.&quot;<br />&quot;She yelps, drops her phone.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;d argue the latter has a stronger cause-effect feel. &nbsp;You could argue the yelp and phone drop are simultaneous, so &quot;dropping&quot; is required. &nbsp;That&#039;s fine by me. &nbsp;Just something to consider. &nbsp;You&#039;ll come across stronger cases.<br /><br /><br />19.<br /><br />The revision: &quot;Behind her a shadow rises. &nbsp;In the phone&#039;s glow, two large yellow eyes burn in the night.&quot;<br /><br />What is a &quot;shadowy shape&quot;? &nbsp;If we don&#039;t describe the shape then it&#039;s no more than an amorphous shadow. &nbsp;I feel we need to lose one or the other:<br /><br />&quot;Behind her a shadow rises.&quot; (shape gone)<br />&quot;Behind her a monstrous shape rises.&quot; (shadow gone)<br /><br />&quot;Burning hot in the night&quot; works. &nbsp;But I notice &quot;burning&quot; and &quot;hot&quot; share a big chunk of Venn Diagram. &nbsp;I&#039;d argue &quot;hot&quot; is expendable. &nbsp;More than that, I&#039;d argue &quot;hot&quot; hurts the sentence by freeloading.<br /><br /><br />20.<br /><br />I&#039;m puzzled how this plays out. &nbsp;Is it a slow, dawning turn to face the beast, or is it a whirl? &nbsp;I suppose it&#039;s up to us to imagine it. &nbsp;A slow turn and then the blown-out silhouette of the attacker when the security lights blast on -- that works. &nbsp;Sensing the towering evil, she whips around to face the harsh bloom of the floodlights and the hulking beast, all in a split second -- that works pretty great too. &nbsp;But if we have to pick the blocking ourselves, that means the author&#039;s hands are off the steering wheel. &nbsp;That&#039;s not good.<br /><br />Let me have a crack at both versions.<br /><br />&quot;She turns slowly, inevitably around. &nbsp;The motion light triggers. &nbsp;She&#039;s trapped in the shadow of her worst nightmare.&quot;<br /><br />Next, let&#039;s go with the sudden turn.<br /><br />&quot;She whirls to confront it. &nbsp;The motion light SNAPS ON. Her pupils pinhole then go WIDE WITH SHOCK.&quot;<br /><br />Oooh, snuck in a camera direction there. &nbsp;Nice.<br /><br />Both are wordy compared to the one-line original. &nbsp;I reckon the extra is totally worth it to really button that bit. &nbsp;(A reminder again that I might be doing silly things to the scene, and the authors might be rolling their eyes in weary sufferance.)<br /><br /></div>

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER HALLWAY - PRE-RECORDED&quot;<br /><br />There&#039;s probably a better TV-production word for it, but it does the job. No chance of confusion now. <br /><br /><br />23.<br /><br />&quot;They work like a well-oiled machine.&quot;<br />&quot;They are a well-oiled machine.&quot;<br /><br />Tiny change, but I do like the no-nonsense, just-the-facts-ma&#039;am feel of the revision.<br /><br /></div>
