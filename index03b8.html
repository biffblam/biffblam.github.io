					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Warner Bros. pays $500K against $800K to aquire spec road crime drama &quot;Father Daughter Time: A Tale of Armed Robbery and Eskimo Kisses&quot; from writer Matthew Aldrich. From Deadline:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The script focuses on a man who goes on the lam with his daughter, his accomplice on a 3-state crime spree. Yesterday, offers were made by Warner Bros, Paramount, Relativity Media, Walter Parkes through his discretionary fund, and Matt Damon and Chris Moore, through a company with money raised through a private investor.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ----<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The spec road wasn&#039;t really the plan, I finished the draft, gave it to my manager and new agents, who loved it, and the idea was to attach a director,&quot; he [Aldrich] said. &quot;It took off from there.&quot; While specs are considered the riskiest form of employment right now, Aldrich said it has worked well for him.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The one film I&#039;ve had produced was a spec, so I guess I&#039;m batting 2 for 2,&quot; he said. &quot;Specs are turning out to be a petty good business model. But the idea wasn&#039;t to make a deal, it was to make a movie. The script is not high concept, it&#039;s a smallish, very personal, dark but playful road movie about a father and daughter.&quot;<br /><br />Aldrich is repped by CAA and manager Jewerl Ross.<br /><br />Damon may be attached to star and make his directorial debut.<br /><br />By my count, this is the 30th spec script to sell this year.<br /><br />The 30th spec script didn&#039;t sell in 2010 until July 14, so sales are up significantly year-to-date.<br /><br />[gointothestory.com]</div>
