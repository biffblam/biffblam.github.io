					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div align="center">(https://10ptt.com/smf/10ptt_shake.gif)</div><br />Trevor Schindeler wants another Wayne&#039;s World.<br /><br />Trevor REALLY wants another Wayne&#039;s World.<br /><br /><div align="center">(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/waynes-world-3-waynes-leisure-world-title.png)</div><br />So he wrote it, he publicized it, he tried to fund it -- well, fund some advertising to drive interest. &nbsp;And Trevor learned the internet is a fickle friend. &nbsp;Now, his GoFundMe page (https://www.gofundme.com/Waynes-World-3) is a cruel 404.<br /><br />That makes me sad. &nbsp;As part of his GoFundMe, he published his screenplay for all to read. &nbsp;I read the first 20-something pages. &nbsp;You&#039;re about to see the first 11. &nbsp;I expect with some dedicated googling you&#039;ll turn up a copy of the full script, if you&#039;re truly interested. &nbsp;I won&#039;t provide it here because that nuked GoFundMe page suggests Trevor changed his mind about his script&#039;s production readiness. &nbsp;(I&#039;m reproducing the pages here under obvious Fair Use terms.)<br /><br />[UPDATE: Script still available (https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6kzyvjld7ht16k/Wayne&#039;s%20Leisure%20World%20Script%208%20Feb%202015.pdf?dl=0)!]<br /><br /><div align="center">(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/waynes_world.jpg)</div><br />Mindful of its first-draft nature, I liked it. &nbsp;There&#039;s no story I could find in that first act. &nbsp;What we get is Wayne and Garth being Wayne and Garth -- except now they&#039;re old and living in a retirement village. &nbsp;No hook, no inciting incident. &nbsp;Just familiar faces and scenarios floating in a sea of possibility. &nbsp;I wanted to read more, but even if the story eventually arrives somewhere in Act Two, there&#039;s no excusing that lazy first act.<br /><br />I do believe there&#039;s something there -- just enough to make me hope Trevor keeps going, keeps improving the screenplay. &nbsp;I like how Trevor shows us a very familiar Wayne and Garth. &nbsp;Reading the scenes, I often forgot I&#039;m supposed to imagine Wayne and Garth as old folks. &nbsp;I kept picturing them as the young men we know and love -- only with less hair and more wrinkles. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s good or bad. &nbsp;Can they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> Garth and Wayne if they&#039;re decrepit and slow and frail? &nbsp;Does age, if depicted accurately, strip them of their essential Wayne&#039;s Worldliness?<br /><br /><div align="center">(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/waynesworldkids.gif)</div><br />Because what we have in these pages, as I see it, is Mike Myers and Dana Carvey wearing deliberately false-looking old-age makeup but otherwise giving the same energetic physical performances we expect.<br /><br />And I&#039;m very much okay with that.<br /><br />We saw something similar recently with DUMB AND DUMBER TO. &nbsp;So why not WAYNE&#039;S WORLD 3? &nbsp;Why not begin with Leisure World Retirement Home? &nbsp;You know, other than all the legal reasons with a spec screenplay based on studio-owned characters and IP...<br /><br />Okay. &nbsp;Maybe you want to know more about how this screenplay came to be. &nbsp;Links ahoy.<br /><br />http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/22/this-guy-has-started-a-gofundme-page-to-get-someone-to-read-his-waynes-world-3-script-5710876/<br /><br />http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/24/waynes-world-3-fortress-hollywood-trevor-schindeler<br /><br />http://www.cinemablend.com/new/One-Random-Guy-Really-Trying-Make-Wayne-World-3-Happen-113867.html<br /><br />http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2016/02/82034-party-on-man-launches-gofundme-campaign-to-get-hollywood-execs-to-read-his-waynes-world-3-script/<br /><br />Alrighty, it&#039;s 10PTT time. &nbsp;This is by no means a good screenplay no matter how you look at it, whether squinting left-eyed at format or right-eyed at structure or gazing omnipotently with your third eye at story. &nbsp;It won&#039;t sell and it won&#039;t get made. &nbsp;Paramount won&#039;t touch it. &nbsp;Why would they? &nbsp;Myers will write his own if he wants to.<br /><br />So, I need to ask: Why, Trevor? &nbsp;Twenty years feeding a naive belief you could get your WW screenplay produced. &nbsp;You might have spent those twenty years crafting a career as screenwriter or director, then -- and only then, with your amassed contacts, skills, industry credibility and audience appeal -- turned your attention to this dream project. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">That&#039;s</span> a reasonable and believable path to success. &nbsp;Instead, twenty years wondering what to do on Mars, the whole time forgetting to build your spaceship.<br /><br />Trevor, deep down you must have known from the start it was a fool&#039;s errand.<br /><br />And yet... a good start.<br /><br />And yet... when have YOU, dear reader, so doggedly refused to give up your dream for so long despite the odds?<br /><br /><div align="center">(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/waynes-world-tattoo.jpg)</div><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fuck it</span>. &nbsp;All of it. &nbsp;Fuck the odds. &nbsp;Fuck the &quot;right&quot; way. &nbsp;Fuck everything except not giving up. &nbsp;In the end, our time expires and we all give up the option of giving up.<br /><br />But not a moment sooner, dear reader. &nbsp;Hold tight. &nbsp;Against an impossible universe, that&#039;s how you win. &nbsp;Go into that long dark night knowing they had to seize it from your warm, dead fist.<br /><br />Oh yeah. &nbsp;Here&#039;s the 10PTT...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/waynes-world-3-waynes-leisure-world-p1.png)<br /><br /><br /><b>NOTES:</b><br /><br />1. &nbsp;&quot;The Year 2047&quot;<br />Don&#039;t tell us twice. &nbsp;Keep the slug clean and let narration supply the context.<br /><br />2. &nbsp;&quot;Things look very much the same...&quot;<br />See what happens when you scrape the fat off the bone? &nbsp;Twenty-one words boiled down to eight. &nbsp;That&#039;s almost a two-thirds reduction without losing meaning or intent. &nbsp;And we&#039;re one sentence into the script!<br /><br />3. &nbsp;&quot;A car drives past...&quot;<br />If we get no information about how the car drives past -- rockets, whips, roars, creeps, coasts, cruises -- then we may as well save a word here and let vanilla be vanilla.<br /><br />4. &quot;Only the upper portion...&quot;<br />I don&#039;t understand what the purpose or payoff is for this thing about not seeing the car&#039;s wheels. &nbsp;I&#039;ll come back here if the other shoe drops later.<br /><br />5. &quot;Drives...&quot;<br />Second instance this paragraph for the bland verb &quot;drives&quot;. &nbsp;Give the car some personality. &nbsp;Anyone watching that car arrive, what would they assume from the model of vehicle? &nbsp;The way it&#039;s being driven? &nbsp;Would it attract attention or go unnoticed? &nbsp;Either warrants a more descriptive verb.<br /><br />6. Present progressive tense<br />See http://10ptt.com/smf/index.php/topic,344.0.html. &nbsp;I bear no love for &#039;ing&#039; and its slovenly affiliates.<br /><br />7. Slug<br />I doubt we need anything here but &quot;INT. CAR.&quot; or &quot;IN THE CAR&quot; &nbsp;It&#039;s a natural segue. &nbsp;Any embellishment only clutters comprehension. &nbsp;Putting that aside, where slug-line clarification is required I prefer the brevity and efficiency &quot;same&quot; achieves over &quot;continuous.&quot; &nbsp;A four-syllable word costs readability, even in a slug, and therefore ought to do more than simply state the obvious.<br /><br />8. Beat breakdown<br />Let&#039;s dissect this paragraph. &nbsp;It conveys this information: (1) A middle-aged man chauffers his elderly mother while (2) I LOVE ROCK N&#039; ROLL by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts plays on the radio, which (3) delights her so much she cranks up the volume.<br /><br />Notice how my one-sentence breakdown connects those three ideas. &nbsp;It flows. &nbsp;The source text kind of throws down each beat without neatly tying them together. &nbsp;It feels like somebody&#039;s stomping on the brake pedal between each idea and we&#039;re bunny-hopping down the road.<br /><br />9. Logistics<br />If in this shot we hear the song end then we only have screen time for a few bars of verse/chorus -- unless this opener is part of an extended under-credits sequence. &nbsp;I&#039;m wondering if the author&#039;s intention is for us to hear I LOVE ROCK &#039;N ROLL right from the opening shot with the car ambling through those retirement home gates. &nbsp;That makes sense. &nbsp;It gives us enough time to let the tune&#039;s head-nodding beat hook us good. &nbsp;So, an alternate opening shot/scene might be watching the mother&#039;s age-spotted, nail-polished fingers find that car radio volume dial to give it an enthusiastic twist, raising Joan Jett to window-shaking decibels. &nbsp;Then cut to ext car as it arrives. &nbsp;That would create immediate intrigue. &nbsp;We know an elderly lady owns that withered hand. &nbsp;Who is she, this old lady who adores classic 80s rock &#039;n roll?<br /><br />9. &nbsp;Time<br />Hit the pause button. &nbsp;We must return to the opening scene, where the author writes &quot;it&#039;s the year 2047.&quot; &nbsp;How does the movie audience know the scene plays out in 2047? &nbsp;Well, they don&#039;t. &nbsp;Sure, we know because the author told us right there on the page in the first sentence of the screenplay. &nbsp;&quot;It&#039;s the year 2047.&quot; &nbsp;But there still has been no visual or verbal manifestation of 2047 on screen. &nbsp;I appreciate much can be left to the intrepid director and the production designer and the dozens of department heads who know how to read between the lines. &nbsp;But here, at notation 9, we have the perfect setup for anchoring the movie audience in 2047.<br /><br />The radio DJ says: &quot;That was I LOVE ROCK N&#039; ROLL by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, which topped the charts back in 1983.&quot; &nbsp;All we need is one more sentence from him -- or a partner radio host -- to seal the deal: &nbsp;&quot;That song might be 64 years old now, but it doesn&#039;t sound a day over 25, which is how old Joan Jett was when the song came out.&quot; &nbsp;Okay, yes, that&#039;s a lot of numbers to plug into a math calculation to arrive at 2047, but it&#039;s a start. &nbsp;For those in the audience willing to mentally crunch the numbers, you let them feel smart instead of just spoon-feeding them context like &quot;Hey, you&#039;re on W-P-I-G and it&#039;s the year 2047!&quot;<br /><br />10.<br />Nipping this in the bud. &nbsp;&quot;Continuous&quot; is a tool to remove ambiguity. &nbsp;Here, as before, there is none.<br /><br />11. Excessive detail<br />Unless all this description about landscaping and groundswork leads to some gag or other, we don&#039;t need it. &nbsp;We&#039;ve established how the retirement home maintains neat and tidy gardens. &nbsp;Belaboring the point creates expectation. &nbsp;If that expectation won&#039;t be paid off, we&#039;re just wasting space.<br /><br />12. &nbsp;Passive sentences<br />Untwist those passive sentences and make them active -- unless you&#039;re deliberately staying passive for effect.<br /><br />13. &nbsp;Repetition<br />Never tell the audience something they already know, unless it&#039;s for deliberate effect. &nbsp;Put &quot;television&quot; in the shot slug or in the description but not both, i.e.:<br /><br />-----<br />ON TELEVISION<br /><br />a cheesy advertisment for Leisure World Retirement Home. &nbsp;An attractive middle-aged couple...<br />-----<br /><br />or perhaps:<br /><br />-----<br /><br />A CHEESY ADVERTISMENT<br /><br />on television sells Leisure World Retirement Home...<br />-----<br /><br />or better:<br /><br />-----<br /><br />A CHEESY TV ADVERTISMENT<br /><br />hard sells Leisure World Retirement Home.<br /><br />-- An attractive middle-aged couple enjoy the facilities<br />-- play golf<br />-- and relax in a luxurious bedroom.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />The first is typical. &nbsp;Shot slugs generally serve to focus the audience&#039;s attention -- on people, things, events. &nbsp;They are your story&#039;s ushers, skillfully guiding you with their torches in the dark, making sure you arrive safely to your seat.<br /><br />14. &nbsp;Redundant<br />The first sentence feels redundant: &quot;We see couples enjoying the facilities then we see a specific couple enjoying the facilities.&quot; &nbsp;Let&#039;s save space and detail the specific couple only, and leave the rest to the imagination/director.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/waynes-world-3-waynes-leisure-world-p2.png)<br /><br /><br /><b>NOTES:</b><br /><br />15. &nbsp;Pedantesque<br />&quot;An attractive middle-aged couple enjoy the facilities.&quot;<br />&quot;Another couple gets served by attentive staff in an elegant dining room.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Couple&quot;: singular or plural? &nbsp;Depends. &nbsp;The singular -- &quot;An attractive couple enjoys the facilities&quot; -- is arguably correct, because the couple perform as a unit. &nbsp;But plural &quot;enjoy&quot; sounds, to my ear, more natural in this sentence. &nbsp;On the other hand, the singular use of &quot;gets&quot; in the second instance feels right as well as being grammatically &quot;correct&quot;. &nbsp;Grammar is robust; it can withstand rough handling so long as the meaning of a sentence is clear.<br /><br />16. In for a penny<br />I try to resist editing dialogue, just because. &nbsp;But I&#039;ll indulge myself this time. &nbsp;This TV ad narration works very well, I think. &nbsp;Which is probably why I feel compelled to give it a quick final inspection, brush off some lint and straighten its tie. &nbsp;&quot;Have meals in our fine dining facility&quot; seemed like a bit of sentence gymnastics intended to maneuver &quot;dining&quot; into the right position. &nbsp;We can&#039;t say: &quot;Dine in our dining lounge.&quot; &nbsp;I like the faux sophistication of &quot;dining lounge&quot; over &quot;fine dining facility&quot; so let&#039;s work with it. &nbsp;How about: &quot;Indulge yourself in our restaurant-quality dining lounge.&quot;<br /><br />17. Transitions<br />Transitions are a personal preference thing. &nbsp;But I can tell you this: you can and should do without them until they become truly necessary in the first production draft. &nbsp;When working on a spec or any first draft you don&#039;t need CUT TOs, except where they remove ambiguity from a scene transition. &nbsp;I&#039;ll give you two good reasons to discard your CUT TOs: &nbsp;(a) You&#039;ll save a small but accumulating amount of whitespace, perhaps enough to contract your 101-page script to 98 or 99 pages. &nbsp;Same as how the silly $9.95 price tag tricks our brains into thinking we&#039;re getting oh such a bargain compared to those suckers paying $10, screenplays with an athletic two-digit page count get a little more love at first sight than those waddling, wheezing three-digit page count monstrosities. &nbsp;(b) Unnecessary transitions interrupt the reading flow. &nbsp;Until your screenplay sells, do everything you can to make those words flow. &nbsp;From sentence to paragraph to scene to sequence -- don&#039;t give the reader cause to stop reading. &nbsp;If you need a transition -- and you will, just not for every scene -- make it a natural one. &nbsp;Make it do something more than divide scenes.<br /><br />Here we have an ideal opportunity to do exactly that. &nbsp;We will make the transition do more than CUT TO.<br /><br />Presently we&#039;re tight on the TV screen watching the Leisure World Retirement Home advertisment. &nbsp;After that we go wide, revealing we&#039;re in Leisure World&#039;s front lounge. &nbsp;So let&#039;s use the transition to enhance context and deepen the narrative flow rather than interrupt it.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />WIDEN TO:<br /><br />INT. LOUNGE - LEISURE WORLD<br /><br />-----<br /><br />And, just like that, no need to remind the reader this scene is &quot;continuous.&quot; &nbsp;We could get creative -- being careful not to go too crazy, mind you.<br /><br />-----<br />REVEAL:<br /><br />INT. LOUNGE - LEISURE WORLD<br />-----<br /><br />That too tells us we&#039;ve gone wide to establish the lounge. &nbsp;I promised not to go crazy, but I can&#039;t help wondering how Spielberg would handle this transition. &nbsp;It might say CUT TO on the page but it sure as shit won&#039;t be a CUT TO on screen.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />NARRATOR: You worked hard all your life. &nbsp;Now it&#039;s time to enjoy your golden years. &nbsp;Let Leisure World give you the freedom you&#039;ve earned and the lifestyle you deserve.<br /><br />CRANKY ELDERLY VOICE (O.S.)<br />I want my MTV!<br /><br />SPLAT! &nbsp;A spoonful of sticky red jelly hits the TV screen, slithers down.<br /><br />In a flash an English Cocker Spaniel named REX is there to lick it off. &nbsp;Nobody pays the little dog any mind, so REX probably belongs to a resident.<br /><br />Unexpected delicious snack gobbled, REX scampers to his next rendezvous, and we FOLLOW --<br /><br />INT. LOUNGE - LEISURE WORLD<br /><br />-- weaving under and around Leisure World&#039;s elderly residents, who look much older and much poorer than the actors in the TV ad.<br /><br />From hairstyle to footwear, the residents are dressed according to popular music genres from their youth: psychedelic rock, Motown, disco, punk, hip hop. &nbsp;Everyone (caregivers too) grooves to classic Rock &#039;n Roll playing on speakers throughout the facility.<br /><br />REX arrives under female resident KATHY who chats with a handsome middle-aged man named ROB. &nbsp;REX ignores Rob, waits for Kathy to ruffle his ears, then DARTS OFF, and we FOLLOW --<br /><br />-----<br /><br />See any CUT TOs in the Spielberg version? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;Just one fresh slug to orient us after the TV ad and not a scrap of doubt about the continuity.<br /><br />Aside: nobody does visual flow like Spielberg. &nbsp;Not even old Spielberg. &nbsp;If you, the screenwriter, can capture in words the kind of narrative flow Spielberg delivers on screen, you&#039;ll go far, oh yes. &nbsp;Spielberg is one shining example of good flow. &nbsp;I bet you can think of others. &nbsp;My point being: don&#039;t let screenplay format and its technical minutia strangle your story flow. &nbsp;Plenty of time for your story to be put in chains when producers come aboard.<br /><br />18. Potted<br />&quot;There are no potted plants.&quot; &nbsp;Glancing ahead, I see this observation repeats and repeats. &nbsp;Either there&#039;s a clever payoff coming or...? &nbsp;Am I missing a running joke carried over from the first movie? &nbsp;I&#039;m intrigued.<br /><br />Aside: 1800 words and we&#039;ve only finished page 2. &nbsp;And you thought it was the script pages undergoing the &quot;torture&quot; test.<br /></div>

Dance for your supper<br />I&#039;m not thrilled with this tiny scene. &nbsp;How do we, the movie audience, know this is &quot;Stacy&quot;? &nbsp;By naming her is the author tagging Stacy as an important character? &nbsp;If Stacy is an important character shouldn&#039;t we see her &quot;in character res&quot;? &nbsp;I bastardized that saying, but my version should totally be a thing because you understand exactly what I mean: seconds after seeing Stacy and studying her we should have some idea of the kind of person she is. &nbsp;If Stacy is nothing more than an extra then why name her? &nbsp;Let&#039;s read on and discover the answer...<br /><br />21. &nbsp;Shocker: eating in the dining room<br />&quot;Residents eat.&quot; &nbsp;That&#039;s the meat in the sentence. &nbsp;Dining room, residents, eating. &nbsp;A two-word slug followed by a two-word sentence works the same as the longer original sentence. &nbsp;But are we at breakfast? &nbsp;Lunch? &nbsp;Dinner? &nbsp;All are possible because we&#039;ve been told only that time of day is DAY. &nbsp;We should pick a meal time. &nbsp;Let&#039;s go for lunch.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />DINING ROOM<br /><br />Residents eat lunch, but not the fine cuisine from the TV ad. &nbsp;These are factory meals served on compartmentalized trays. &nbsp;Like in prison.<br /><br />ANNE, mid 20s, attractive but intense, sits with resident TOM. &nbsp;Tom&#039;s hands flutter restlessly. &nbsp;He seems not to notice. &nbsp;Parkinson&#039;s Disease? &nbsp; No. &nbsp;These aren&#039;t tremors or spasms. &nbsp;These are gestures, rehearsed and eloquent. &nbsp;These are the hands of a magician, now retired. &nbsp;Holding an invisible wand. &nbsp;A pretend top hat. &nbsp;An imaginary rabbit. &nbsp;Forty years of stage work grooved deep in his brain -- and stuck on repeat.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Took a long stroll there, but I&#039;m back now. &nbsp;Here&#039;s what happened along the way: I took a 19-word paragraph and I stuffed it like a turkey until it fattened to 89 words -- four times as long. &nbsp;Oops. &nbsp;I indulged myself to demonstrate what storytelling sentences look like. &nbsp;Storytelling sentences work two jobs. &nbsp;Day job: describe to the reader the plain facts and keep the story moving forward. &nbsp;Night job: make the reader feel something about these characters and what&#039;s happening to them.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know yet if Anne and Tom are main characters, so I can&#039;t say if one or the other deserves a proper character intro. &nbsp;If they do, we need more than plain facts. &nbsp;We need to be intrigued by these characters right from the meet-cute. &nbsp;Character introductions should create questions for us. &nbsp;Why dress like that? &nbsp;Why say that? &nbsp;Why do that? &nbsp;Nothing is what it is without cause.<br /><br />So far in this screenplay we&#039;ve been given no character intros. &nbsp;Cathy, Rob, Stacy, Anne, Tom -- all introduced with no description, no traits, no CHARACTER. &nbsp;Some get an implicit or explicit age tag, and that&#039;s all. &nbsp;We understand that any person labeled as &quot;resident&quot; will be elderly, so we don&#039;t need an explicit age indicator. &nbsp;What we do need is some small understanding about these characters. &nbsp;Something on which to hang our expectations. &nbsp;We want clues early about how this character and that one might fit into the story.<br /><br />I did a bit of that in my revision above: &quot;attractive but intense.&quot; &nbsp;One extra word to offset &quot;attractive&quot; and create some tension. &nbsp;How do we get &quot;intense&quot; from her? &nbsp;She doesn&#039;t speak in this brief shot so all we have is her body language, her posture, how she sits, how she&#039;s dressed. &nbsp;Give an actor &quot;attractive but intense&quot; and soon you&#039;ll learn exactly how a performer conveys those two qualities without needing to say a word.<br /><br />Same goes for my fluffing of &quot;male resident TOM.&quot; &nbsp;I overcooked it, but you gotta admit Tom&#039;s a lot more interesting in my intro.<br /><br />Movies are about characters and relationships and how those relationships come together and break apart and come together between FADE IN and THE END; about how those relationships CHANGE. &nbsp;While those relationships churn, lives are sacrificed and saved. &nbsp;Perhaps entire galaxies prosper or perish. &nbsp;And still, none of that is half as important as the relationships between your characters.<br /><br />Did I make my case for character intros? &nbsp;I hope so. &nbsp;I fight savagely and often to convince you to trim words and reduce page count. &nbsp;But not here. &nbsp;Character intros are exempt. &nbsp;Save words elsewhere and spend that coin during character intros. &nbsp;First impressions count.<br /><br /><br />22. &nbsp;Silky smooth<br /><br />INT. LOUNGE - LEISURE WORLD<br />...<br />HALLWAY<br />...<br />DINING ROOM<br />...<br />EXT. PARKING LOT<br />...<br /><br />See how that works? &nbsp;The EXT signals we&#039;re outside now. &nbsp;No time of day in the slug signals we&#039;re CONTINUOUS. &nbsp;We omitted a bunch of unnecessary (for a spec) screenplay scene scaffolding and we gained readability and whitespace.<br /><br /><br />23. Let it be<br />The author instinctively knows how this bit will play out: in a single traveling shot. &nbsp;We should let the description be what it wants to be. &nbsp;Don&#039;t fight it. &nbsp;Unleash it.<br /><br />-----<br />EXT. PARKING LOT<br /><br />ELECTRICAL CABLES<br /><br />run out the back of a rusty Aurora Cable 10 truck, across the LAWN, through an open BASEMENT WINDOW to a --<br /><br />STUDIO MONITOR<br /><br />And there they are: our boys, WAYNE CAMPBELL and GARTH ALGAR. &nbsp;We&#039;re just in time for --<br /><br />WAYNE AND GARTH<br />(on monitor, singing)<br />Wayne&#039;s World! &nbsp;Wayne&#039;s World! &nbsp;Party Time. &nbsp;Excellent!<br /><br />Some things never change. Some things do. &nbsp;Our boys are 84 years old. &nbsp;Wayne still keeps his long black mullet despite a monk-like bald spot. &nbsp;Garth&#039;s unruly mane is now silver-grey and he wears thick framed glasses. &nbsp;Both have on their familiar ripped jeans and t-shirts.<br />...<br /><br />-----<br /><br />24.<br />We know they&#039;re elderly. &nbsp;Give us something else. &nbsp;Describe that close-up the way an audience sees it. &nbsp;Make us feel the horror. &nbsp;Garth and Wayne are old, man. &nbsp;LOOK AT THEM. &nbsp;Exactly when did the universe turn so cruel?<br /><br />[Uh oh. &nbsp;I&#039;ve put 3,000 words on the dial and we&#039;re only at page 3. &nbsp;Note to self: git along, lil doggy.]<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">(https://10ptt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/waynes-world-3-waynes-leisure-world-p8.png)<br /><br /><br /><b>NOTES:</b><br /><br /><br />26.<br />This dialogue-heavy bit runs three pages -- and mercifully shortens this 10PTT. &nbsp;I like how it begins, with the &quot;magic trick,&quot; but by the end it feels stretched and strained. &nbsp;The scene will improve with a tighten and a trim -- perhaps down to a page and a half. &nbsp;Sure, by all means let&#039;s see the lads doing their shtick. &nbsp;But are we missing a chance to illustrate how old they&#039;ve become? &nbsp;I guess it depends on what the screenwriter has in store for us. &nbsp;Will old Garth and Wayne be shown as mostly unaffected by old age? &nbsp;Still the same old Garth and Wayne, still capable of their heyday hijinx? &nbsp;Or are we watching a Wayne and Garth youthful in mind and spirit but decrepit in body? &nbsp;If so, we should see how time has wearied them, how they can&#039;t quite deliver the same physically manic performance of yesteryear.<br /><br />This is our first scene with the guys. &nbsp;It has to ROCK. &nbsp;It must be hilarious or endearing or both. &nbsp;It must tell us -- preferably visually -- what their predicament is. &nbsp;It must link into the inciting incident around the corner. &nbsp;It must do a bunch of these things all at once. &nbsp;What is must not do is simply return to the same old WAYNE&#039;S WORLD except everyone&#039;s old.<br /><br />27.<br />A CUT TO and a full-bodied slugline is a must here. &nbsp;I don&#039;t need to do a thing. &nbsp;We&#039;ve jumped in time and location, so every part of the slug has a job to do.<br /><br />28. &nbsp;&quot;A number of residents are in the lounge.&quot;<br />This is filler and should go. &nbsp;If it&#039;s important to know how full the lounge is, try: &quot;Jammed with residents.&quot; &nbsp;Or &quot;Almost empty.&quot; &nbsp;If it&#039;s unimportant then say nothing.<br /><br />Does it matter where they sit? &nbsp;Couch, chair, stool? &nbsp;I&#039;m guessing, yes, it&#039;s important that Kathy and Rob SHARE the couch, suggesting intimacy. &nbsp;If that&#039;s the author&#039;s intent, don&#039;t leave the reader guessing and grasping: make it so!<br /><br />-----<br />Among the chatting residents, Kathy and Rob share a couch. &nbsp;Rob listens attentively.<br />-----<br /><br />or, if they wanted some privacy...<br /><br />-----<br />Away from the gabbling residents, Kathy and Rob share a couch. &nbsp;Rob listens attentively.<br />-----<br /><br />I snuck in some character POV there with &quot;gabbling.&quot; &nbsp;To me it suggests Kathy and Rob dislike the other noisy residents.<br /><br /><br />29. !!<br />Don&#039;t repeat things you told us earlier.<br /><br />And I&#039;d argue for striking KATHY&#039;s &quot;(intently).&quot; &nbsp;The way her line is written already suggests a focused tone and delivery.<br /><br /><br />30.<br />Slight problem now. &nbsp;This new scene, slugged as MORNING, feels suspiciously like a CONTINUOUS from an earlier scene. &nbsp;In that earlier scene -- which precedes our establish on the basement studio -- we had this exact tableau: Rob and Kathy chatting together and dog Rex playing with an elderly resident. &nbsp;It seems too much of a coincidence for that tableau to repeat the next day. &nbsp;This leads me to believe that we are, in fact, CONTINUOUS from the basement scene, that we have not CUT TO the next day, as I first thought.<br /><br />If this is true, why was I led astray?<br /><br />Poor slugline management. &nbsp;The script begins with DAY as the slugged time of day. &nbsp;From there it&#039;s all CONTINUOUS until the present scene, slugged as MORNING. &nbsp;To go from DAY to MORNING implies a night between. &nbsp;Else why not use MORNING in that first scene slug instead of DAY? &nbsp;It&#039;s confusing. &nbsp;And if it&#039;s confusing then the writer has failed the reader.<br /><br />31.<br />Well, there&#039;s Anne and Tom together again. &nbsp;In the earlier scene, the two were sitting together. &nbsp;Here, they&#039;re playing shuffleboard. &nbsp;Does this mean it&#039;s NOT a continuation of the earlier scene? &nbsp;I&#039;M SO CONFUSED!<br /></div>

Skip the minutia<br />Do as little stage management as possible. &nbsp;Movies are life with the boring bits cut out. &nbsp;Same for screenplays: cut out the boring bits where people walk from here to there and back. &nbsp;In any case, we have a natural match cut with:<br /><br />WAYNE: Is Mary around?<br />BRUCE: I&#039;ll look.<br /><br />We could cut to one of a hundred different scenes of Bruce doing something, somewhere, and every time we&#039;d be thinking: &quot;Ah-ha, he&#039;s looking for Mary.&quot; &nbsp;We could cut from Bruce&#039;s &quot;I&#039;ll look&quot; to him in an astronaut&#039;s suit bouncing across the surface of the moon and we&#039;d assume that&#039;s where Mary is. &nbsp;Bruce told us he&#039;d go look for her and here he is, in the next shot, looking for her -- thanks to the implicit manipulation of movie editing.<br /><br />So. &nbsp;If we don&#039;t need to be told a second time, let&#039;s skip the boring stage directions that move Actor A upstage to Mark B.<br /><br />-----<br />WAYNE: (to camera) Is Mary around?<br /><br />BRUCE: I&#039;ll look.<br /><br />ADMINISTRATOR&#039;S OFFICE<br /><br />Bruce leans in, spots Leisure World&#039;s ancient administrator, MARY, entrenched behind heaped papers and precariously stacked files.<br /><br />BRUCE: Hi, Mary. &nbsp;You know we have computers for that now...<br /><br />Due to her shrunken height and the rampart of paperwork, she has to stand to see him.<br /><br />MARY: Don&#039;t trust &#039;em. &nbsp;Push the wrong button and suddenly it&#039;s dubya dubya triple eye.<br /><br />BRUCE: Wayne wants to speak with you.<br /><br />MARY: What now? &nbsp;His boa constrictor escape again?<br /><br />LOUNGE<br /><br />Mary and Bruce emerge from her office adjoining the lounge.<br /><br />MARY: (sunnily) Good morning, Wayne. &nbsp;How are you today?<br /><br />WAYNE: (to camera) Fantastic! &nbsp;Awesome! &nbsp;There are some people who want to meet you.<br /><br />Mary looks around in confusion, then at Bruce -- who shrugs.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Let&#039;s back it up and explain how context and LESS screenwriting scaffolding works to our advantage here.<br /><br />&quot;ADMINISTRATOR&#039;S OFFICE&quot; -- no INT. &nbsp;That tells us we have not substantially relocated. &nbsp;Therefore, we can assume this office is within the retirement home and probably nearby.<br /><br />&quot;MARY: Don&#039;t trust &#039;em. &nbsp;Push the wrong button and suddenly it&#039;s dubya dubya triple eye.&quot; &nbsp;We describe Mary as &quot;ancient&quot; and &quot;shrunken.&quot; &nbsp;We sketched her as an old lady buried in a trench of paperwork. &nbsp;And finally, we give her a personality trait: she mistrusts technology.<br /><br />I&#039;d say that&#039;s a step up from the original dry intro: &quot;MARY, a female administrator.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><b>END 10PTT</b><br /><br />Aaaaaand at page 11 we&#039;re done. &nbsp;I hoped to wrap up this 10PTT with an inciting incident, but I found none. &nbsp;I scanned ahead to page 23: still nothing. And what about the hook? &nbsp;The opening with the son driving his mother to this retirement home? &nbsp;They&#039;re not major characters? &nbsp;Not even minor characters? &nbsp;Maybe they return in Act Two. &nbsp;It&#039;s rather odd. &nbsp;What&#039;s very clear is, this screenplay has serious structural voids weakening the story. &nbsp;How can I finish Act One not knowing what the movie&#039;s about?<br /><br />BUT. &nbsp;I do like the Wayne and Garth stuff from that first act. &nbsp;I think the author got pretty close to the classic &quot;yes, it&#039;s so stupid, but try not to laugh&quot; tone we expect.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, these script pages left me wanting more WAYNE&#039;S WORLD. &nbsp;I reckon that means Trevor Schindeler delivered on his &quot;you had one job!&quot; promise. &nbsp;Thank you, Trevor. &nbsp;If we&#039;re getting another BILL AND TED (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted_(franchise)#Potential_third_film), we gotta have another WAYNE&#039;S WORLD.</div>
